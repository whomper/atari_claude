# Claude ST: the build conversation

The full conversation in which Claude ST was built: every prompt Erez
wrote and every reply Claude gave, in order, from the first prompt on
2 October 2026 to 2026-10-10. It is the raw material for a step-by-step guide;
[BUILD_STORY.md](BUILD_STORY.md) is the short version.

About this export:
- **Included:** 82 prompts and Claude's written replies, unedited.
- **Left out:** the commands Claude ran, the files it read and wrote, and its
  internal reasoning. The code that came out of each step is in the git history.
- **Images:** screenshots and photos Erez attached are marked *[image attached]*;
  the images themselves are not included.
- **One redaction:** a pasted list of claude.ai chats (7 October) is replaced
  by the few lines that mattered, because it held unrelated private chats.
- Times are UTC.

Let's build a Claude.ai Atari ST/Falcon application. It should allow me native access to my Claude.ai account. I should see on the left the previous chats plus the usual options like New, Projects, Artifacts etc and to the right side the large display of active chat.

### Claude

I've got an m68k cross-compiler and the Hatari emulator (plus EmuTOS) installed so I can build and actually test the app. Next I'll write the GEM client and the bridge it talks to.

Writing the Atari-side C code now (TOS bindings done; next the GEM/VDI bindings and the app itself).

The Atari program compiles (CLAUDE.PRG, ~16 KB). Next I'll check that it only uses plain 68000 instructions, then boot it in the Hatari emulator.

Atari app builds cleanly; now writing the bridge's main program (serial/TCP/emulator links + protocol handling).

The app boots in the emulator and is talking to the bridge over the emulated serial port. Taking a screenshot to check the UI.

Debugging: the app starts and sends its hello, but the window isn't showing yet. Investigating.

Found it: the AES/VDI parameter-block address was being passed by value instead of by address. Fixing.

The debug trace shows GEM calls returning zeros — traced it to my ELF→TOS converter mis-relocating the data section. Fixing.

The app is up and running in the emulator — sidebar, chat pane, input box, and the chat list fetched over the serial link. Now testing interaction (clicking a chat, typing a message).

Opening a chat works. Now sending a message.

Streaming replies render live with auto-scroll. Checking one small glitch (the "thinking…" indicator).

Works, but the text pane flickers on each new line during streaming (it clears and redraws). I'll make it blit-scroll the screen instead and redraw only new rows — much smoother on a real 8 MHz ST.

Final rendering is correct; the intermediate frame just caught a redraw mid-way. I'll cut unnecessary sidebar repaints (status-only updates now repaint just the status line).

Now testing Projects, Artifacts, Search and New chat flows.

All flows work (projects, artifacts, search, new chat). Now checking colour ST medium resolution and Falcon rendering.

Colour medium-res works (red Claude accent). Now the Falcon.

Falcon (68030, VGA 640×480) renders fine too. Now writing a bridge test suite, docs, and the protocol spec.

The test caught a real streaming bug (links split across chunks weren't reformatted). Fixing.

Tests pass. Capturing screenshots for the README.

Spotted a real bug in that screenshot: the "You" header went missing — the blit-scroll's dirty-row bookkeeping was off when several scrolls happen between redraws. Fixing.

Headers render correctly now. Verifying the blitted screen is pixel-identical to a full redraw:

Pixel-identical. Retaking the README screenshots.

Tests pass (14). Final rebuild, then commit and push.

I've built **Claude ST**, a GEM app for the ST/STE/TT/Falcon with the layout you asked for: the sidebar on the left (**+ New chat**, Search, Chats, Projects, Artifacts, then your recent chats) and the active chat in the large pane on the right, with a reply line at the bottom. Replies stream in as Claude writes them.

It runs in the Hatari emulator with sample chats: opening a chat, sending a message, projects, artifacts and search all work there. It hasn't connected to your real claude.ai account yet, because I don't have your login here. It also hasn't run on a real Falcon.

**How it connects:** an Atari can't handle the encryption claude.ai requires, so a small helper program (the "bridge") runs on a modern computer. It connects to the Atari by serial cable (or a WiFi modem) and does the internet side.

**Things to know:**
- **Using your claude.ai account isn't officially supported.** claude.ai has no public API for personal accounts. The bridge signs in with your browser's `sessionKey` cookie and uses the same private connections the website uses. That means it could stop working whenever claude.ai changes. The cookie gives full access to your account, so keep it private.
- **There's a stable alternative.** The bridge can use the official Anthropic API instead (`--backend api`, needs an API key). The catch is that those chats are saved on your computer, not in your claude.ai account. I set it to use Claude Opus 5.5, with automatic retry on another model if a request is declined.
- **Artifacts are found by scanning chats.** claude.ai doesn't have one list of all your artifacts, so the Artifacts view searches your 15 most recent chats.
- **Falcon:** the screen works on the emulated Falcon (640×480). Hatari can't connect the Falcon's serial port, so that link is untested. On a real Falcon, plug into the 9-pin Modem port.

**To try it on your Falcon:**
1. Copy `atari-claude/st/CLAUDE.PRG` to the Falcon.
2. Connect the Falcon's Modem port to your computer with a null-modem cable (a USB-serial adapter works).
3. On the computer, run:
   ```
   pip install -r atari-claude/bridge/requirements.txt
   export CLAUDE_SESSION_KEY='sk-ant-sid01-...'
   python3 atari-claude/bridge/claude_bridge.py --serial /dev/ttyUSB0
   ```
4. Start CLAUDE.PRG.

To check the cable first, run the bridge with `--backend demo`, which uses sample chats and needs no internet.

Everything is in `atari-claude/` on `claude/upbeat-mendel-lbm2rj`, including a prebuilt `CLAUDE.PRG`. The README has wiring for each machine, how to copy the session cookie, and keyboard shortcuts.

## Erez, 2026-10-02 16:05

I have the Raspberry pi from my other online accessibility flows for email and web so can we use it as a gateway?

### Claude

The installer works end to end in the dry run. One more fix: if no session key is set yet, the gateway now keeps running and shows "set the key" on the Atari, instead of restarting over and over.

Scratchpad isn't accessible to the service user; using a neutral directory.

Confirmed: the installed copy runs as the service user, and with no key it reports the problem instead of crashing. Cleaning up the test install, then updating the docs.

Yes, your Pi works as the gateway: it runs the bridge as an always-on service, with your Atari on a serial cable and claude.ai reached over your home network. I couldn't set it up from here, though. This session runs in the cloud and can't reach 192.168.68.126 on your home network. You'll need to run one install command on the Pi yourself.

**Wiring:** use a USB-to-RS-232 adapter on the Pi and a null-modem cable to the Atari's Modem port. Don't connect the Atari straight to the Pi's GPIO pins: the Atari uses ±12 V signals, which will damage the Pi.

**On the Pi:**
```sh
ssh pi@192.168.68.126
git clone -b claude/upbeat-mendel-lbm2rj https://github.com/whomper/YouTube.git claude-st
cd claude-st/atari-claude/pi
sudo ./install.sh        # asks for your claude.ai sessionKey (typing is hidden)
```
If the repository is private, `git clone` will ask you to sign in to GitHub. Alternatively, copy the `atari-claude` folder over with `scp`.

After that it starts at every boot and finds the USB adapter by itself.

**How it behaves as an unattended service:**
- It won't interfere with your email and web flows. It runs under its own user and adds only its own folders and one service called `claude-st`.
- Problems show up on the Atari. If claude.ai is unreachable, the session key has expired, or no key is set, the message appears in the Claude ST chat window. When the Atari retries, the gateway tries again.
- If the adapter is unplugged, the service restarts once it's back.
- When claude.ai logs you out, run `sudo ./install.sh --set-key` and paste the new key.
- `sudo ./install.sh --uninstall` removes it.

I tested the installer here with the system commands faked. It installed, created the service user, wrote a settings file only root and the service can read, and ran the bridge with no key, which reported the problem as intended. The bridge tests also pass (16). It hasn't run on a real Pi yet, so if anything misbehaves, send me the output of `journalctl -u claude-st -n 50`. The Pi steps and a command table are in the README, and both changes are pushed to `claude/upbeat-mendel-lbm2rj`.

Look, I do not want any wire, only wireless connection between my Atari at 192.168.68.129 and the Pi at 192.168.68.126

### Claude

Pulling HighWire (an Atari web browser that talks to STinG) as a reference for the exact STinG calling conventions, since I can't download STinG itself here.

Now a fake STinG driver (a resident AUTO-folder program that tunnels the "TCP" over the emulated serial port). It lets me run Claude ST's real STinG code path end to end in Hatari.

The STinG path works: Claude ST read `CLAUDE.INF`, found STinG, and opened TCP to 192.168.68.126:2323. Checking the screen:

Chatting works end to end over the STinG code path. Now checking the "STinG not loaded" status and the `/connect` command, which should save `CLAUDE.INF`:

Found a crash: `/connect` hit an address error (a 16-bit store at an odd address) while saving `CLAUDE.INF`. Locating it:

`/connect` now saves correctly with no crash. Rerunning both the STinG path and the serial path on the final builds:

TCP gateway tests pass (19 total), covering Atari-IP-only access and reconnect after a stale connection. Updating the Pi installer with a wireless mode:

Installer modes all work: wireless setup, re-running keeps the wireless settings, and `--port` switches back to serial. Smoke-testing the installed service in wireless mode, as the service user:

Smoke test passed. Now the docs, and a ready-made `CLAUDE.INF` pointing at your Pi.

The connection is now fully wireless: Claude ST talks to the Pi over your network through STinG, so there's no cable between them. I couldn't run the install on your Pi from here (this session can't reach your home network), so it needs two quick steps on your side.

**On the Pi (192.168.68.126):**
```sh
git clone -b claude/upbeat-mendel-lbm2rj https://github.com/whomper/YouTube.git claude-st
cd claude-st/atari-claude/pi
sudo ./install.sh --network --atari 192.168.68.129
```
It asks for your claude.ai session key, then runs at every boot. It accepts connections only from your Atari's address (192.168.68.129), and if your Pi uses the `ufw` firewall it opens the port for that address only. It doesn't touch your email and web setups.

**On the Atari (192.168.68.129):** with STinG loaded, put `CLAUDE.PRG` and `CLAUDE.INF` from the `st/` folder in the same folder and start `CLAUDE.PRG`. `CLAUDE.INF` already points at your Pi (`tcp 192.168.68.126 2323`). The status line shows *Connecting…* and then *Online*. If the Pi restarts or the WiFi drops, Claude ST reconnects by itself.

**Changes on the Atari side:**
- To change the address later, type `/connect <ip>` in the reply line.
- **Options** in the menu bar now has a choice between network and serial.
- In network mode the app leaves the serial port alone, in case STinG itself uses it.

**What's tested:** I couldn't get the real STinG here, and the emulator has no network card. So I took STinG's exact calling rules from the source of HighWire, an Atari web browser that uses STinG. Then I wrote a stand-in driver that behaves like STinG inside the emulator. Through it, Claude ST read `CLAUDE.INF`, connected to 192.168.68.126 on port 2323, and sent and received chats; the serial mode still works too. On the Pi side, all 19 bridge tests pass, including connections from addresses other than the Atari's being refused. The installer and service also worked in a dry run here.

**Bug fixed along the way:** testing caught a crash when typing `/connect` on a plain 68000. The compiler was producing a memory write the 68000 can't do. I fixed it for the whole build, and the fixed `CLAUDE.PRG` is the one now in the repository.

The first real STinG connection will be on your Atari. If the status line shows an error instead of *Online*, send me that text along with the output of `journalctl -u claude-st -n 30` on the Pi.

**One recommendation:** set up a DHCP reservation in your router for both machines so their addresses don't change. Everything is pushed to `claude/upbeat-mendel-lbm2rj`, and the README now covers the wireless setup first.

## Erez, 2026-10-02 18:40

Is this code in my GitHub? I don't find it

### Claude

Yes, it's in your GitHub. I just checked: the whole `atari-claude` folder is in the `whomper/YouTube` repository. You probably can't see it because GitHub opens the main branch by default, and the code is on a separate branch called `claude/upbeat-mendel-lbm2rj` that hasn't been merged into main yet.

**To see it:**
- Open this link directly: https://github.com/whomper/YouTube/tree/claude/upbeat-mendel-lbm2rj/atari-claude
- Or, on the repository page, click the branch dropdown (it says **main**, top left above the file list) and choose `claude/upbeat-mendel-lbm2rj`. The `atari-claude` folder then appears.

The Pi install commands I gave you already use this branch (`git clone -b claude/upbeat-mendel-lbm2rj …`), so they work as written.

If you'd like it on the main branch, I can open a pull request for you to merge. That repository also runs your YouTube analytics jobs, which save their reports to main every hour. Merging only adds the new `atari-claude` folder and a short note at the end of the README, so those jobs are unaffected.

## Erez, 2026-10-02 18:41

why did you put it there and not a new repository? Create a new one called Atari_claude

### Claude

I couldn't create Atari_claude: GitHub refused (error 403) because the Claude GitHub app isn't allowed to create repositories in your account.

The new repository is ready to go, though. I've set it up here with everything from the `atari-claude` folder at the top level (33 files, one commit), and updated the README and installer paths and the Pi install command to point at `whomper/Atari_claude`. All it needs now is an empty repository on GitHub to push into.

**What you need to do (about a minute):**
1. Go to https://github.com/new and create **Atari_claude**. Leave it empty: no README, `.gitignore` or license, or the first push will fail. I suggest **Private**, because the code contains your home network addresses.
2. Give the Claude GitHub app access to the new repository at https://claude.ai/connect-github. If you limited it to selected repositories, add Atari_claude there.
3. Tell me when it's done. I'll push the code and send you the link.

One thing to know: because the repository is private, the `git clone` on your Pi will ask for your GitHub username and a personal access token instead of your password. Alternatively, copy the folder to the Pi with `scp`.

Once it's in Atari_claude, do you want me to remove the `atari-claude` folder from the YouTube branch so there's only one copy? That branch was never merged, so your YouTube analytics on main are unaffected either way.

## Erez, 2026-10-02 18:43

I have created an atari_claude repository

## Erez, 2026-10-02 18:43

I have created an atari_claude repository

### Claude

The code is now in your new repository: https://github.com/whomper/atari_claude

I checked on GitHub: everything is on its `main` branch (the Atari app, the bridge, the Pi installer, the README and the screenshots). The access request you declined wasn't needed, because the push worked without it.

The README and the Pi installer now point at this repository. To install on the Pi:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/whomper/Atari_claude.git
cd Atari_claude/pi
sudo ./install.sh --network --atari 192.168.68.129
```

If the repository is private, `git clone` will ask for your GitHub username and a personal access token rather than your password.

A copy still sits in the YouTube repository on the `claude/upbeat-mendel-lbm2rj` branch. It was never merged, so your YouTube analytics are unaffected. Should I delete that branch so there's only one copy? Any future changes will go to `atari_claude`.

## Erez, 2026-10-02 18:45

delete the old branch under YouTube repo

### Claude

I couldn't delete the branch from here. GitHub rejected the delete twice (error 403) because this session isn't allowed to delete branches. The branch is still on GitHub, and nothing else changed.

It holds only the three Claude ST commits, all of which are now in `atari_claude`, so nothing is lost by deleting it. You can delete it yourself in a few seconds:

1. Open https://github.com/whomper/YouTube/branches
2. Find `claude/upbeat-mendel-lbm2rj` and click the trash-can icon next to it.

Your `main` branch, the analytics jobs, and the two other `claude/…` branches already in your YouTube repo won't be touched.

## Erez, 2026-10-02 18:49

How do I fill the claude.ai sessionKey

### Claude

You copy the key from a browser where you're logged in to claude.ai, then paste it into the installer on the Pi. It has to be a desktop browser, because phone browsers don't show cookies.

## 1. Copy the key from your browser

**Chrome or Edge**
1. Go to https://claude.ai and make sure you're logged in.
2. Press **F12** (or **Cmd+Option+I** on a Mac) to open the developer tools.
3. Open the **Application** tab. If you don't see it, click **»**.
4. In the left column, go to **Storage → Cookies → https://claude.ai**.
5. Click the row named **sessionKey** and copy the entire **Value**. It starts with `sk-ant-sid`.

**Firefox**
1. Go to https://claude.ai and press **F12**.
2. Open the **Storage** tab, then **Cookies → https://claude.ai**.
3. Copy the full value of **sessionKey**.

**Safari (Mac)**
1. First, turn on **Safari → Settings → Advanced → Show features for web developers**.
2. Go to https://claude.ai and press **Cmd+Option+I**.
3. Open the **Storage** tab, then **Cookies → claude.ai**.
4. Copy the full value of **sessionKey**.

## 2. Paste it into the Pi

Log in to the Pi from the same computer, so you can paste:

```sh
ssh pi@192.168.68.126
cd Atari_claude/pi
```

- **If you haven't installed it yet:** run `sudo ./install.sh --network --atari 192.168.68.129`. It will ask you to paste the key.
- **If it's already installed, or the key ever stops working:** run `sudo ./install.sh --set-key`.

The input is hidden, so nothing appears on screen when you paste. That's expected. Paste once and press **Return**. The bridge restarts with the new key.

## Good to know

- **Treat the key like a password.** Anyone who has it can use your claude.ai account. Don't email it or put it in a file in the repository. The installer stores it in `/etc/claude-st/claude-st.env`, which only root and the service can read.
- **It expires.** It stops working when you log out of claude.ai in that browser, or after some weeks. When that happens, the Atari's chat window shows a "refused the session" error. Copy a fresh key the same way and run `sudo ./install.sh --set-key` again. Staying logged in to claude.ai in that browser keeps the key valid longer.
- **To check it's working:** run `journalctl -u claude-st -f` on the Pi, then start Claude ST on the Atari. You should see "Atari connected from 192.168.68.129", and your recent chats appear in the Atari's sidebar.

## Erez, 2026-10-02 18:51

give me the atari downloads

### Claude

The two files the Atari needs are attached above:

- **CLAUDE.PRG** (22 KB): the Claude ST program. It's the same build I tested in the emulator.
- **CLAUDE.INF** (25 bytes): the connection setting. It contains `tcp 192.168.68.126 2323`, which points at your Pi.

They're also in your repository under `st/`: https://github.com/whomper/atari_claude/tree/main/st

**To set it up on the Atari:**
1. Copy both files into the same folder on the Atari, from a floppy, hard disk, or SD/CF card. Keep the names exactly as they are, in capitals.
2. Make sure STinG is loaded and the network is up.
3. Double-click `CLAUDE.PRG`. The status line at the bottom left should show *Connecting to 192.168.68.126* and then *Online*.

The Pi gateway has to be installed and have your session key before the Atari can connect.

Don't copy `FAKESTNG.PRG` from the `tools` folder in the repository to the Atari. It's only a stand-in I used for testing in the emulator, and it would replace your real STinG network connection.

## Erez, 2026-10-02 19:09

I gave it a try and it works, quit well dare I say.

Now, I need a few enhancements:

1. Add a right click menu on the chats or projects items in the left menu with similar operations as the actual web interface, such as the ones in the attached screen capture.
2. The separator between the left menu and the main text area should allow resizing of the two areas

*[1 image attached]*

### Claude

Glad it's working well. I'll add both:

1. **Right-click menu** on sidebar items: Open, Pin/Unpin, Rename, Move to project, Delete for chats; Open, Pin/Unpin, Rename, Archive, Delete for projects. It will also be reachable from the keyboard.
2. **Draggable divider** between the sidebar and the chat area. The width you set will be remembered.

First I'll set up real mouse testing (a virtual display plus mouse automation driving Hatari), and check how EmuTOS reports right clicks.

Writing the Atari-side changes now: popup menu, rename mode, the project picker, and divider dragging.

Now the main claude.c changes:

The Atari side builds. Now the bridge: the new commands (rename, pin, move, archive, delete, project picker) for all three backends.

Both sides build. Adding bridge tests for the new actions, then I'll drive the real mouse in the emulator: right-click, menu selection, and dragging the divider.

27 bridge tests pass. Now the real-mouse test: Hatari on a virtual X display, driven with xdotool.

The emulated ST mouse tracks the host pointer exactly, so I can click real coordinates. Right-clicking "Fix my GFA BASIC loop":

The right-click menu opens with hover highlighting. Clicking **Pin**:

Pinned: the chat jumps to the top with a pin marker, and the area the menu covered was repainted cleanly. Next, **Rename**:

Rename works. Next, **Move to project** (the project list is fetched from the bridge):

Closer look: my click landed on the separator, and a click there correctly cancels the menu. Retrying at the right coordinates:

The project picker works, but the first menu wasn't repainted before the picker opened (the AES's repaint message was still queued). The popup will now repaint our window immediately when it closes.

Clean now. Picking "Demoscene", then opening Projects ▸ Demoscene to confirm the chat moved:

Move to project works. Now **Delete**, which asks for confirmation first:

Delete works. Now **dragging the divider** from about x=185 to x=300:

Everything works: the width persists across restarts (labels no longer truncated), and the keyboard route opens the same menu. Updating the README and protocol docs, then committing:

Both enhancements are in. The new `CLAUDE.PRG` is attached and pushed to https://github.com/whomper/atari_claude.

**1. Right-click menu on sidebar items**
- **Chats:** Open, Pin/Unpin, Rename…, Move to project…, Delete…
- **Projects:** Open, Pin/Unpin, Rename…, Archive, Delete…
- Pinned items move to the top of the list with a small diamond, like claude.ai's Starred section.
- Rename puts the current name in the reply line. Edit it and press Return, or press Esc to cancel.
- Move to project shows a second popup listing your projects.
- Delete always asks first.
- From the keyboard: Tab to the item, press **Insert**, then use the arrow keys and Return.

I left out Mark as unread, Share, Copy link and Open in. They're tied to the web interface and have no equivalent on the Atari.

**2. Resizable divider**
- The pointer turns into a hand over the divider line. Drag it, and a guide line follows the mouse.
- When you let go, the text reflows to the new width.
- The width is saved in `CLAUDE.INF`, so it's kept after you restart.

**How I tested it:** this time I drove the emulator with a real mouse (right-clicks, menu choices, dragging the divider) rather than only the keyboard. Every action reached the bridge and updated the sidebar. The 27 bridge tests also pass.

**Bugs I found and fixed during testing:**
- A very quick click could be missed by the menu. It now takes clicks from the AES's own event queue, so none are lost.
- Holding the mouse button down on a sidebar item used to repeat the action. Each click now acts once.

**What to update:**
- **On the Atari:** replace `CLAUDE.PRG`. Keep your `CLAUDE.INF`; it now also stores the sidebar width.
- **On the Pi:** the bridge has the new commands, so run `git pull` in the `Atari_claude` folder, then `sudo ./install.sh` from its `pi` folder. If you skip this, the menus open but the actions fail.

**One caveat:** on your claude.ai account, rename, pin, move, archive and delete use claude.ai's private web endpoints, and I couldn't try those against a real account. I based them on how the claude.ai website works. If any of them fails, claude.ai's error appears in the Atari's chat pane. Tell me which one and I'll fix it.

## Erez, 2026-10-02 19:45

when I'm clicking on a list item with the right mouse button, make sure it is highlighted first before opening the popup window as it is not clear on which item the popup window commands will take effect

### Claude

I'll highlight the item before the menu opens and keep it highlighted while the menu is up. The menu will also open just below the item, or above it near the bottom of the list, so it doesn't cover the item it applies to.

Built. Testing with the mouse: I'll open one chat, then right-click a different one, so the screenshot shows how the targeted item differs from the open chat.

The emulator's pointer drifted off target (it sits at the left edge), not the app's fault. Moving in smaller steps keeps it in sync:

The pointer isn't following at all, so the app may be stuck. Checking whether it still responds:

The highlight stays on the item while you rename it. Cancelling with Undo should return the highlight to the open chat:

The mouse path works too: the right-clicked item is highlighted before the menu appears, the open chat switches to an outline, and the menu opens just below the item. Committing:

Right-clicking an item now highlights it before the menu appears, so it's clear which chat or project the command applies to. The new `CLAUDE.PRG` is attached and pushed to https://github.com/whomper/atari_claude.

- **The highlight stays for the whole action:** while the menu is open, through the Delete confirmation, while you choose a project for "Move to project", and while you edit a name with Rename. Once the action is done or cancelled, the highlight returns to the open chat.
- **The open chat shows as an outline** while another item is highlighted, so the two are never confused.
- **The menu no longer covers the item.** It opens just below it, or just above it when the item is near the bottom of the list.
- **No delay:** only the rows that change are repainted, so the highlight appears instantly even at 8 MHz.

Pressing Tab to an item and then Insert works the same way.

I checked all of this in the emulator with both a mouse right-click and the keyboard. The screenshot shows a right-clicked chat highlighted, the open chat outlined, and the menu below it.

To update, just replace `CLAUDE.PRG` on the Atari. The Pi doesn't need any change this time.

## Erez, 2026-10-02 19:56

This works well. Now, there are cases where the text is in Hebrew. I do see Hebrew characters, but the text is left to right instead of right to left. Can this be handled?

### Claude

Yes. Atari TOS has no right-to-left text support, so I'll add a compact bidirectional-text layout to Claude ST itself:

- Each paragraph's direction comes from its first strong letter. Hebrew paragraphs are right-aligned and read right to left.
- English words and numbers inside Hebrew text keep their left-to-right order, and Hebrew phrases inside English text are reversed in place.
- Brackets are mirrored as needed.
- The same applies to chat titles in the sidebar, the title bar, and the input line, so typed Hebrew displays correctly.

On the bridge, I'll also map Hebrew punctuation (maqaf, geresh, gershayim), drop vowel points (niqqud) and invisible direction marks, which the Atari font doesn't have. Starting with the code that touches line types:

I'll put the bidi logic in its own module, `bidi.c`. It can be compiled on Linux as well, so I can unit-test it directly:

The flagged `?` is just the question mark in "Atari Falcon?". The test was wrong, not the output. Fixing the test:

Now checking it on screen in the emulator: Tab to the Hebrew demo chat (it's first in the list) and open it.

Hebrew now displays right to left in Claude ST. The new `CLAUDE.PRG` is attached and pushed to https://github.com/whomper/atari_claude. The screenshot shows a mixed Hebrew/English chat in the emulator.

**What changed on the Atari**
- **Hebrew paragraphs** are right-aligned and read right to left. A paragraph's direction comes from its first letter, so a Hebrew line that starts with a number still reads right to left.
- **Mixed text** comes out the way a browser shows it. English words and numbers inside Hebrew keep their order ("Atari Falcon 030", "1992", "65,536"). Punctuation lands on the correct side, and brackets are mirrored. A Hebrew phrase inside an English paragraph is reversed in place, and the paragraph stays left to right.
- **Headings and bullet points** follow the paragraph's direction; in Hebrew the bullet dash sits on the right.
- **Chat titles** in the sidebar and title bar display correctly too. Hebrew titles in the sidebar are right-aligned.
- **The reply line:** if you type Hebrew, it's shown right to left, with the cursor on the left side.
- **Speed:** lines with no Hebrew skip the extra processing, so English text is no slower.

**What changed on the bridge**
- The Atari's font has only the plain Hebrew letters, so the bridge drops vowel points (niqqud) and the invisible direction marks. Previously each of these came out as `?`.
- Maqaf, geresh and gershayim become `-`, `'` and `"`.

**Tests:** the right-to-left logic has its own unit tests (`make test` in `st/`), all passing. The bridge tests pass too (28). I also checked the chat view and the sidebar in the emulator with a Hebrew demo chat. I couldn't test typing Hebrew in the reply line in the emulator, though: it uses the same layout code, but that part hasn't been seen on screen.

**What to update**
- **On the Atari:** replace `CLAUDE.PRG`.
- **On the Pi:** run `git pull` in the `Atari_claude` folder, then `sudo ./install.sh` from its `pi` folder, so the bridge cleans up the vowel points and punctuation. Without that update, Hebrew still displays right to left, but vowel points arrive as `?`.

How can I test it from Hatari?

### Claude

On your own computer, Hatari's emulated serial port can connect to the bridge through two named pipes (FIFOs). Claude ST then works exactly as it would over a cable. This works on macOS and Linux. Windows has no named pipes, so it isn't covered here.

I'll add a script that sets this up in one command, and test it here first.

I added a script, `tools/hatari-test.sh`, that sets everything up in one command. I ran it here from scratch: Hatari booted into Claude ST, which came online with the demo chats, the Hebrew one included.

## Steps (Mac or Linux)

1. **Install Hatari.** On Linux, run `sudo apt install hatari`. On a Mac, get the installer from https://hatari.tuxfamily.org/download.html.
2. **Get the code and start the demo:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/whomper/Atari_claude.git
   cd Atari_claude
   tools/hatari-test.sh
   ```
   Hatari opens straight into Claude ST with sample chats, including one in Hebrew, so you can check the right-to-left display. No account is needed. The first run downloads EmuTOS, a free replacement for TOS, automatically.
3. **Use your real claude.ai account:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r bridge/requirements.txt
   export CLAUDE_SESSION_KEY='sk-ant-sid01-...'
   tools/hatari-test.sh claudeai
   ```
   Your actual chats with Hebrew text should appear right to left.

## Options

- `MACHINE=ste tools/hatari-test.sh` runs an STE in colour (medium resolution).
- `TOS=/path/to/your-tos.img tools/hatari-test.sh` uses your own TOS image instead of EmuTOS.
- Quitting Hatari stops the bridge too.

## Limits

- **It uses the serial link, not the network.** Hatari can't emulate a network card, so STinG can't be tested in the emulator. In this mode the bridge runs on your computer, not the Pi.
- **Choose an ST, STE or TT.** Hatari only connects the serial port of those machines to the bridge, not the Falcon's. Claude ST behaves the same on all of them.
- **Windows isn't covered.** The script needs named pipes, which Windows doesn't have. On Windows, run it on Linux (WSL) or a Mac.

The script and these steps are now in your repository; the README has a new section, "Trying it in Hatari".

## Erez, 2026-10-02 20:11

I am getting Hatari isn't installed: https://hatari.tuxfamily.org/download.html
  (Linux: sudo apt install hatari; macOS/Windows: installers on that page)

### Claude

That message means the script can't find Hatari. You're probably on a Mac, where Hatari installs as an app (`Hatari.app`) rather than as a `hatari` command, so the script doesn't see it. I'll make the script find the Mac app automatically.

Both cases behave correctly: with Hatari installed as a Mac app and no `hatari` command, the script finds the app and starts it. With no Hatari at all, you get the clearer message. Committing:

The script was only looking for a `hatari` command, but on a Mac Hatari installs as an app (`Hatari.app`) with no such command. I've fixed the script to find the app, and the fix is in your repository.

**What to do (Mac):**

1. If you haven't installed Hatari yet: download the macOS version from https://hatari.tuxfamily.org/download.html and drag **Hatari.app** into your **Applications** folder.
   - The script also looks in your **Downloads** folder and in `~/Applications`.
   - The first time, macOS may say the app can't be opened because it's from an unidentified developer. Right-click Hatari.app, choose **Open**, and confirm once. After that the script can start it.
2. Get the update and run it again:
   ```sh
   cd Atari_claude
   git pull
   tools/hatari-test.sh
   ```
   It should print `Using Hatari: /Applications/Hatari.app/...` and then open the emulator.

If Hatari is somewhere else, tell the script where the program inside the app is:
```sh
HATARI=/path/to/Hatari.app/Contents/MacOS/Hatari tools/hatari-test.sh
```

I tested the fix with a stand-in Mac app layout, since I don't have a Mac here. The script found the app and passed it the right settings, and with no Hatari present it gave the clearer error message. If you're on Linux rather than a Mac, `sudo apt install hatari` is all you need. If it still doesn't start on your Mac, paste me the exact output.

## Erez, 2026-10-02 20:16

there is an Hatari in the application folder under Hatari

### Claude

The app is inside a folder: `/Applications/Hatari/Hatari.app`. The script only looked directly in `Applications`, so it missed it. Fixing it to look one folder deeper too:

The script now finds Hatari in `/Applications/Hatari/Hatari.app`. I recreated that folder layout here and the script picked up the app, and the fix is pushed to your repository.

Run:
```sh
cd Atari_claude
git pull
tools/hatari-test.sh
```

It should print `Using Hatari: /Applications/Hatari/Hatari.app/Contents/MacOS/...` and open the emulator with Claude ST and the demo chats.

If macOS blocks Hatari the first time with a message about an unidentified developer, right-click **Hatari.app** in Finder, choose **Open**, confirm, close Hatari, and run the script again.

## Erez, 2026-10-02 20:24

is there any option to type Hebrew text on the falcon keyboard?

### Claude

TOS has no Hebrew keyboard layout of its own, so I'll build one into Claude ST: a Hebrew typing mode that works like a PC's Hebrew layout (the Israeli standard SI-1452: T types א, A types ש, and so on).

- **Toggle with F10**, or with a new **Options ▸ Hebrew keyboard** menu item.
- **"HE" marker:** a small marker in the reply box shows when Hebrew mode is on.
- **Shift still types English capitals**, as on a PC's Hebrew layout.
- **Keys go by position, not label,** so it works on any national Atari keyboard.
- **The setting is saved** in `CLAUDE.INF`.

Built. Testing: press F10, then type the keys `akuo gcrh`, which should produce "שלום עברי", and send it:

Yes, you can now type Hebrew on the Falcon. TOS doesn't include a Hebrew keyboard layout, so I added one to Claude ST. The new `CLAUDE.PRG` is attached and pushed to https://github.com/whomper/atari_claude.

**How to use it**
- Press **F10** to switch Hebrew typing on or off. You can also use **Options ▸ Hebrew keys**.
- While it's on, an **HE** badge appears at the right of the reply box.
- The letter keys follow the standard Israeli PC layout (SI-1452), so they match a Hebrew PC keyboard.

| Key | Hebrew |   | Key | Hebrew |   | Key | Hebrew |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| E | ק | | A | ש | | Z | ז |
| R | ר | | S | ד | | X | ס |
| T | א | | D | ג | | C | ב |
| Y | ט | | F | כ | | V | ה |
| U | ו | | G | ע | | B | נ |
| I | ן | | H | י | | N | מ |
| O | ם | | J | ח | | M | צ |
| P | פ | | K | ל | | , | ת |
| Q | / | | L | ך | | . | ץ |
| W | ' | | ; | ף | | / | . |

- **Shift still types English capital letters**, as on a PC, so you can mix in an English word without switching modes. Digits, the space bar and Ctrl/Alternate shortcuts work as usual.
- **Keys go by position, not by the printed letter,** so this works whatever language your Falcon's keyboard is.
- **Hebrew typing stays on after a restart.** The setting is saved in `CLAUDE.INF` until you press F10 again.

As you type, the text shows right to left with the cursor on the left, and it's sent to Claude as normal Hebrew. In the emulator I typed "שלום עברי", sent it, and it reached the bridge exactly; it also became the new chat's title in the sidebar.

To update, replace `CLAUDE.PRG` on the Falcon. The Pi needs no change.

That background notice is about an earlier test of the Mac Hatari detection. It hung because it found the real Hatari on this machine instead of the stand-in Mac app, and has now been stopped. I reran that test properly afterwards and it passed, so nothing needs doing.

## Erez, 2026-10-03 06:13

Are all settings stored in the .INF file automatically_

### Claude

Not quite: the network address, the sidebar width and the Hebrew keyboard are saved, but the baud rate isn't. Fixing that:

The baud rate now survives a restart: it was read back from `CLAUDE.INF` and kept when another setting was saved. Documenting all the saved settings in the README and committing:

Yes, now they are. When I checked, every setting was saved except the baud rate, which went back to 19200 at each start. I've fixed that; the new `CLAUDE.PRG` is attached and pushed.

`CLAUDE.INF` now holds every setting, saved the moment you change it:

| Setting | How you change it | Line in CLAUDE.INF |
|---|---|---|
| Connection (network or serial) | `/connect <IP>`, `/serial`, or the **Options** menu | `tcp 192.168.68.126 2323` or `serial` |
| Baud rate *(newly saved)* | **Options** menu | `baud 19200` |
| Sidebar width | dragging the divider | `sidebar 240` |
| Hebrew keyboard | F10 or **Options ▸ Hebrew keys** | `keyboard hebrew` |

It's a plain text file, so you can also edit it in any text editor. I tested the baud fix in the emulator: a saved `baud 9600` was read at startup and kept when another setting was saved.

Two things are deliberately not saved: the window size and position (Claude ST always opens full-screen), and which chat was open (it starts on a new chat). Tell me if you'd like either remembered.

To update, replace `CLAUDE.PRG` on the Falcon. Your existing `CLAUDE.INF` keeps working; the baud line is added the first time any setting is saved.

## Erez, 2026-10-03 06:36

A few more changes:

1. When the context switches to another area, for example clicking on Search, the main window text should clear as it is confusing because it give the impression that any activity is related to it.
2. When renaming a chat or project, there should be a popup window with the rename option and a text field to edit. At present the edit location is confusing and not intuitive

### Claude

Two good catches. My plan:

1. **Clear the main pane when switching areas.** Choosing Search, Chats, Projects or Artifacts (or opening a project) will empty the conversation pane, title it after that area, and show a one-line hint about what to do there. The bridge is told too, so anything typed next starts a new chat instead of going into the chat that was open before.
2. **A proper Rename dialog.** A GEM-style box titled "Rename chat" or "Rename project", with a text field holding the current name and **Cancel** / **Rename** buttons. The item stays highlighted behind it, Hebrew typing and right-to-left display work in the field, and long names aren't cut short.

Writing the Atari-side changes: area switching first, then the dialog.

Now the Rename dialog itself:

Built. Now the bridge side: a quiet `NEW` that doesn't overwrite the area's title.

The bridge tests pass (31). Testing in the emulator: open a chat, then switch to Search and Projects, then rename a chat through the new dialog.

Renamed, and the area the dialog covered was repainted cleanly. Now moving the dialog over the chat pane, then testing Hebrew typing in it:

Both changes are in. The new `CLAUDE.PRG` is attached and pushed to https://github.com/whomper/atari_claude.

**1. Switching areas clears the main window**
- Clicking **Search**, **Chats**, **Projects** or **Artifacts**, or opening a project, now empties the conversation pane.
- The title bar shows where you are (for example "Search" or "Projects"), with a one-line hint such as "Type words from a chat's title in the box below and press Return."
- What you type next starts a new chat, so it can't land in the chat that was on screen before. After you open a project, the new chat is created inside that project.
- **Search** is now highlighted in the sidebar as soon as you start a search, not only once results arrive.

**2. A Rename dialog**
- **Rename…** in the right-click menu opens a dialog box titled "Rename chat" or "Rename project". It has the current name in a text field and **Cancel** / **Rename** buttons, with Rename as the default.
- The dialog opens over the chat area, so the item you're renaming stays visible and highlighted in the sidebar.
- **Return** or **Rename** saves. **Esc**, **Undo** or **Cancel** closes the dialog without changing anything.
- **Backspace** deletes, and **Clr/Home** clears the field so you can type a new name from scratch.
- **F10** switches to Hebrew typing, shown right to left inside the field.
- Long names now appear in full in the field instead of cut off.

**Testing:** I checked both in the emulator, all with the keyboard:
- Each area clears the pane.
- Renaming a chat sent the new name and updated the sidebar.
- Cancelling sent nothing.
- Hebrew typing works in the field.

I couldn't click the dialog's buttons in the emulator this time; they use the same click handling as the right-click menu, which I tested earlier. The bridge tests pass (31).

**To update:**
- Replace `CLAUDE.PRG` on the Falcon.
- On the Pi, run `git pull` in the `Atari_claude` folder, then `sudo ./install.sh` from its `pi` folder. Otherwise, switching areas still clears the pane, but the title bar may show "New chat" instead of the area's name.

## Erez, 2026-10-03 06:43

In both edit controls, the navigation arrows do not work. It means I can not edit a letter, I need to delete via backspace and type everything post the edit

### Claude

I'll give both text fields a real cursor. The plan:

- **← / →** move the cursor one character, and typing inserts at the cursor.
- **Shift+← / →** jump to the start or end, and **Ctrl+← / →** move by word.
- **Backspace** deletes before the cursor and **Delete** deletes after it.
- With Hebrew, the arrows follow the visual direction, the cursor is drawn between the correct letters even in mixed Hebrew/English, and long text scrolls to keep the cursor in view.

One shared line editor will serve both the reply line and the Rename dialog.

The visual-position map works (unit-tested). Now the shared line editor in Claude ST:

Now the Rename dialog uses the same editor:

Built. Testing the reply line in the emulator: type "Hello wrld", press ← three times, insert "o". Then Shift+← to jump to the start, Delete the "H", and send.

You can now fix a single letter in both the reply line and the Rename dialog without retyping. The new `CLAUDE.PRG` is attached and pushed to https://github.com/whomper/atari_claude.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| **←** / **→** | Move the cursor one character |
| **Shift + ←** / **→** | Jump to the start or end |
| **Ctrl + ←** / **→** | Jump a word at a time |
| **Backspace** | Delete the character before the cursor |
| **Delete** | Delete the character after the cursor |
| Typing | Inserts at the cursor |

- **Long text** scrolls sideways to keep the cursor in view.
- **Hebrew:** the arrows move in the direction they point on screen, so in Hebrew text **←** moves toward the end of the word. The cursor appears between the correct letters, including in mixed Hebrew/English.
- **Unchanged:** ↑/↓ still scroll the conversation. In the dialog, **Clr/Home** still clears the field and **Esc** still cancels.

**Tested in the emulator:**
- **Reply line:** I typed "Hello wrld", moved back three letters and inserted the missing "o", then jumped to the start and deleted the first letter. The text sent was exactly "ello world".
- **Rename dialog:** I deleted and replaced a word in the middle of a chat's name, and the new name was sent correctly.
- **Hebrew:** in "שלום", I moved two letters along and inserted ע; the screen showed the cursor in the right place, and "שלעום" was sent.

To update, replace `CLAUDE.PRG` on the Falcon. The Pi doesn't need any change this time.

## Erez, 2026-10-03 13:31

One last thing I need here is a better About dialog. It should be nicely formatted, like a modern application about box, and should contain my first and last name (Erez Yaary) plus the year 2026. Also it should have a nice application icon that you should generate, one that draws a bit from the Claude.ai logo but does not infringe on copyright and connects with the atari ST legacy

### Claude

I'll design a 1-bit pixel-art icon, as an Atari ST icon would be. Rather than copying either company's logo, it combines two ideas:

- **The Atari side:** the silhouette of the ST's classic SM124 monochrome monitor, a dark CRT screen, and a GEM-style command prompt.
- **The Claude side:** a simple, symmetric eight-ray "spark" on the screen. It nods to Claude's starburst without copying it: Claude's mark is an irregular orange shape, while this is a generic pixel asterisk, closer to an asterisk character.

The About box will be a modern-style dialog: the icon, the app name and version, a one-line description, "Created by Erez Yaary" and "© 2026 Erez Yaary", the current connection, an OK button, and a small line saying this is an unofficial client and naming the trademark owners. First, the icon:

The About box builds. Opening it in the emulator (Help key) in ST high resolution:

The fine print is now readable in the smaller font, but its first line is too long and runs past the dialog's edge. I'll split it into three short lines and add a little spacing:

That looks right. Checking ST medium resolution (colour, 640×200) too, where the icon is drawn 2× wide only:

The medium-resolution version fits and the icon keeps its proportions. Taking a final high-resolution screenshot for the README, then committing:

The new About box and the application icon are done. The new `CLAUDE.PRG`, a screenshot of the About box and the enlarged icon are attached, and everything is pushed to https://github.com/whomper/atari_claude.

**The About box** opens from **Desk ▸ About Claude ST…** or the **Help** key. Top to bottom, it shows:
- the icon, then **Claude ST**, "Version 1.1" (I bumped the version for all the new features), and "Claude.ai for the Atari ST, TT and Falcon"
- **Created by Erez Yaary** and **© 2026 Erez Yaary**
- the current connection and whether it's online, for example "Gateway 192.168.68.126:2323 • online"
- a short note in the smaller system font: unofficial client, not affiliated with Anthropic or Atari, and whose trademarks Claude and Atari are
- an **OK** button. Return, Esc, Help, the space bar or a mouse click also close it.

I checked it in the emulator in ST high resolution and in colour medium resolution, and it fits both.

**The icon** is 32×32 one-bit pixel art, drawn at double size in the About box:
- **The Atari side:** the outline of the ST's classic SM124 monochrome monitor, with a dark screen and a GEM-style `>_` prompt.
- **The Claude side:** a plain, symmetric eight-ray spark on the screen, reminiscent of Claude's starburst. It's a simple pixel asterisk rather than Claude's irregular orange shape, and the Atari Fuji logo isn't used at all.

The icon is drawn by a script, `tools/icon/make_icon.py`, which also writes `st/CLAUDE.ICN`. That's a standard icon file you can load into an Atari icon editor to give `CLAUDE.PRG` its own icon on the Falcon desktop.

I'm not a lawyer, so this isn't a legal opinion on the trademarks. The icon is original artwork rather than a copy of either logo, and the About box states that this is an unofficial client.

To update, replace `CLAUDE.PRG` on the Falcon.

## Erez, 2026-10-03 13:43

what about a 16 color icon in the about? Create a version of the same 1 bit in 16 colors

### Claude

A 16-colour version is a nice touch. On a 16-colour (or higher) screen, such as Falcon or TT colour modes, the About box will show it. ST high and medium resolution don't have enough colours, so they keep the black-and-white icon. The colour version keeps the same pixel shapes and adds:

- a putty-beige case like a real Atari monitor, with darker bevel shading and a dark outline
- a dark-blue CRT screen with a small glare highlight
- the spark in a warm terracotta orange, with a lighter centre
- the `>_` prompt in green phosphor, and a green power light

One technical point: Atari palette numbers map to different hardware colour registers in each video mode, so I'll draw the icon with VDI colour fills rather than copying pixel data. The eight colours are set only while the About box is open and restored afterwards, so the rest of the screen isn't affected.

The colour version looks right, and yes, it's exactly what the About box will show when the screen has 16 or more colours, falling back to the black-and-white icon otherwise. Wiring it in:

Built. Testing in a 16-colour mode: Hatari's TT in TT-medium resolution (640×480, 16 colours), with the serial link working:

The colour icon shows correctly in the About box on the 16-colour TT screen. Closing the box to confirm the screen's colours are restored, then committing:

The About box now shows the 16-colour icon whenever the screen has 16 or more colours, which covers the Falcon's and TT's colour modes. On ST high (black and white) and ST medium (4 colours) it still shows the black-and-white icon. The new `CLAUDE.PRG`, a screenshot and the enlarged colour icon are attached, and everything is pushed to https://github.com/whomper/atari_claude.

**The colour icon** keeps the same pixel shapes as the black-and-white one:
- a putty-beige case like a real Atari monitor, with darker bevel shading and a dark outline
- a dark-blue CRT screen with a small glare in the corner
- the spark in a warm terracotta orange with a light centre, the `>_` prompt in green phosphor, and a green power light

**How it works:** the icon uses eight of the 16 screen colours. They're switched to the icon's colours only while the About box is open and put back as soon as it closes, so the rest of the screen and other programs aren't affected. The icon is drawn the same way in every video mode, so it should come out the same in the Falcon's 16-colour, 256-colour and true-colour modes.

**Testing:** I tested in the emulator on a TT at 640×480 with 16 colours. The colour icon displayed correctly, and the screen's colours came back after closing. I couldn't test the Falcon's own colour modes in the emulator, because Hatari's Falcon can't connect to the bridge, but the program runs the same colour-icon code there. I also checked that ST high still shows the black-and-white icon.

To update, replace `CLAUDE.PRG` on the Falcon. Then, in any colour mode, open **Desk ▸ About Claude ST…** or press Help.

## Erez, 2026-10-03 15:40

Do I have the two icons as stand alone files I can use on the Atari platform to embed in resource files for desktop?

### Claude

Not yet. What you have now is `st/CLAUDE.ICN`: the black-and-white image only, in the ICN text format, with no mask, which desktop icons need. The colour version only exists inside the program. I'll make a proper set of files for icon and resource editors, including a resource file with both icons ready to copy into a desktop icon resource. First, checking what EmuTOS can load, so I can verify the files in the emulator rather than just generating them:

EmuTOS's AES supports colour icons, so I can check the generated file by actually loading and drawing it. Reading EmuTOS's resource loader to get the colour-icon file format exactly right:

Test program built (it loads the resource with the AES's own `rsrc_load`). Running it in EmuTOS, first on the 16-colour TT screen:

You do now. Before this, you only had the black-and-white image as an ICN file, with no mask and no colour version. Both icons are now standalone Atari files, attached and in the `icons/` folder of https://github.com/whomper/atari_claude:

| File | What it contains |
|---|---|
| **CLAUDE.RSC** | A GEM resource file with both icons, each with its mask and the label "Claude ST": the black-and-white icon and the 16-colour icon. |
| **CLAUDE.ICN** | The black-and-white image, in the ICN format used by icon editors. |
| **CLAUDEMK.ICN** | Its mask, in the same format. |

**To use them on the Falcon desktop:**
1. Open `CLAUDE.RSC` in a resource editor such as Interface, ORCS or RSM.
2. Copy the icon you want into the desktop's icon file: `DESKCICN.RSC` for colour icons (TOS 4, on the Falcon), or `DESKICON.RSC` for black-and-white.
3. On the desktop, assign that icon to `CLAUDE.PRG` (TOS 4's Install Icon).

**About the colour icon:** desktop icons can't carry their own colours, so it's adapted to the standard 16 system colours: a grey case, black screen, red spark with a yellow centre, and a green prompt. It looks a little different from the About box version, which can set its own colours. On a screen with fewer than 16 colours, the system shows the black-and-white image automatically.

**How I checked it:** I wrote a small test program that loads `CLAUDE.RSC` with the Atari's own resource loader and draws both icons. In the emulator:
- On a Falcon and a TT in colour, both icons drew correctly; the attached image shows the Falcon.
- On an ST in black and white, the colour icon correctly fell back to the black-and-white image.

The first attempt showed wrong colours: colour icon files store hardware colour registers, not palette numbers, so black came out red. That's fixed in the files you have.

I haven't tested the files in an actual resource editor or on real TOS 4, only with EmuTOS's resource loader. If your editor won't open the file, tell me which editor and what it says.

## Erez, 2026-10-03 18:06

The Artifacts option generates an error as seen from the attached image. Also, selecting an entry to the left should switch to the selected one upon mouse down and not mouse up

*[1 image attached]*

### Claude

Two separate issues:

1. **The Artifacts error** is a bug I introduced with the pin feature. Chat lists from the claude.ai backend now carry a third value (pinned or not), but the code that scans your recent chats for artifacts still expected two. The demo backend has no such code, so my tests missed it.
2. **Selection happening on mouse-up:** the click is actually handled on mouse-down, but the screen isn't redrawn until after the button is released. That makes it look like it acts on release.

Fixing both, starting with the bridge:

The bridge tests pass (34). Confirming the new test actually catches the original bug, by running it against the old bridge code:

Against the old code, the test reproduces your exact error, "too many values to unpack (expected 2)", and with the fix it passes. Now the mouse-down responsiveness:

Testing in the emulator with a real mouse: press the button on a chat, take a screenshot while it's still held down, then release.

While the button is still held, the chat is highlighted and fully loaded. Committing:

Both are fixed; the new `CLAUDE.PRG` is attached, and both fixes are pushed to https://github.com/whomper/atari_claude. Thanks for the photo; the error message pointed straight at the cause.

**1. The Artifacts error (fixed on the bridge)**
- **Cause:** a bug I introduced with the Pin feature. The chat list from your claude.ai account now includes whether each chat is pinned. The code that scans your recent chats for artifacts was still reading only name and ID, so it crashed. Opening a project had the same latent problem, also fixed.
- **Why the tests missed it:** they used the demo backend, which doesn't have this code.
- **Now covered:** I added tests that run the claude.ai code with fake server replies. Against the old code they reproduce your exact error ("too many values to unpack"), and they pass with the fix.

**2. Selecting on mouse-down (fixed in the Atari app)**
- The click was already acted on when you pressed the button, but the screen wasn't redrawn until you let go, so it looked like the selection happened on release.
- Now the item highlights the moment you press, and the chat loads while the button is still down. I checked this in the emulator by holding the button down: the chat was fully loaded before release.
- Holding the button still opens the item only once.

**To update:**
- **On the Pi**, for the Artifacts fix: in the `Atari_claude` folder, run `git pull`, then `sudo ./install.sh` from its `pi` folder.
- **On the Falcon:** replace `CLAUDE.PRG`.

The Artifacts list itself relies on claude.ai's private web interface. I've tested the code path with fake data, but not against your real account. If Artifacts opens but shows nothing or an error, send me another photo.

## Erez, 2026-10-03 18:14

give me the commands for the Pi

### Claude

On the Pi (192.168.68.126):

```sh
ssh pi@192.168.68.126
cd ~/Atari_claude
git pull
cd pi
sudo ./install.sh
```

Running `install.sh` with no options keeps your existing settings: wireless mode, your Atari's address (192.168.68.129) and your claude.ai session key. It copies in the fixed bridge and restarts the service, so it won't ask for anything.

**To check it's running:**

```sh
systemctl status claude-st
journalctl -u claude-st -f
```

The first should show **active (running)**. The second follows the live log: click **Artifacts** on the Falcon and you should see the request arrive with no error. Press Ctrl+C to stop watching.

**If `cd ~/Atari_claude` fails:** you may still have the earlier copy from the YouTube repository, which is now out of date. Fetch the new repository and run its installer instead:

```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/whomper/Atari_claude.git
cd Atari_claude/pi
sudo ./install.sh --network --atari 192.168.68.129
```

Your session key is stored separately on the Pi, in `/etc/claude-st/claude-st.env`, so the installer won't ask for it again. The repository is private, so when `git` asks for a password, use a GitHub personal access token rather than your GitHub password. Once it works, you can delete the old copy.

## Erez, 2026-10-03 18:21

I can click the artifacts option but the artifacts list is empty. It should be filled with the artifacts with the option to download

### Claude

An empty list means the bridge found no artifacts. Two likely reasons, and I can't see your account's data to tell which:

1. **It only looks in your 15 most recent chats**, so older artifacts are never found.
2. **claude.ai stores artifacts in more than one format.** Older chats embed them as `<antArtifact>` tags in the reply text, and newer ones create them as files (`create_file` / `str_replace`). The bridge only recognised one older format.

My plan:

- **Find more artifacts:** recognise all three formats and scan more chats (40 by default). Results are cached, so opening Artifacts again is quick.
- **Never leave a blank list:** if nothing is found, the pane will say so and say how many chats were scanned.
- **Download:** right-click an artifact for **Save to disk…**. That opens the standard GEM file selector with a suggested name, such as `SNAKE.PY` or `README.MD`, and saves the artifact as a text file with Atari line endings.
- **A probe command for the Pi:** it reports which block types your recent chats contain, without any content, so you can send me the output if the list is still empty.

Starting with the bridge:

Next, the bridge's Save and Fetch commands, the "nothing found" message, and the `--probe` option:

Built. Testing in the emulator: open Artifacts, right-click an artifact (via Insert), choose **Save to disk…**, accept the file selector, then check the saved file on the emulated hard disk:

I've made the Artifacts list find much more, and added saving artifacts to the Atari's disk. I couldn't test against your real account, so I can't promise your list will now fill.

**Why the list was empty**

The bridge only recognised one way claude.ai stores artifacts, and only looked in your 15 most recent chats. claude.ai actually uses three formats: an artifact tool, `<antArtifact>` tags in older chats, and files Claude creates. The bridge now:
- reads all three formats
- scans your 40 most recent chats, and only re-reads chats that have changed, so reopening the list is quick
- says "No artifacts found in your 40 most recent chats" instead of showing a blank list

**Saving an artifact**
1. Right-click an artifact, or press Tab to it and then Insert, and choose **Save to disk…**.
2. The GEM file selector opens with a suggested name, such as `SNAKE_GA.PY` or `NOTES.MD`. Pick a folder or change the name, then click OK.
3. The file is written to disk and you get a confirmation with its size.

Files are saved as text, converted to the Atari character set with Atari line endings, so they open normally in Atari editors.

**Testing:** the bridge tests (38) cover all three formats and the saving steps. In the emulator I saved an artifact through the file selector (screenshot attached) and checked the file on disk byte for byte. All of this used sample data.

**To update**

On the Pi:
```sh
cd ~/Atari_claude
git pull
cd pi
sudo ./install.sh
```
On the Falcon, replace `CLAUDE.PRG`.

**If the list is still empty,** run this on the Pi and send me the output:
```sh
sudo -u claude-st bash -c 'set -a; . /etc/claude-st/claude-st.env; /opt/claude-st/venv/bin/python /opt/claude-st/bridge/claude_bridge.py --probe'
```
It prints only counts of what your recent chats contain (for example `12  tool_use:create_file`), never any of their text. From that I can see where your artifacts are stored and fix the bridge to match.

## Erez, 2026-10-03 18:32

Now I see artifacts in the list but clicking any artifact other than the top two produces a message stating it is not found

### Claude

I can see why: it's an ID length problem. Each sidebar item carries an ID, and the Atari keeps up to 39 characters of it. Artifacts that Claude created as files are identified by their full file path (like `/mnt/user-data/outputs/…`), which is longer, so the Atari cut those IDs short. The bridge then couldn't find the shortened ID, hence "not found". The top two are the older kind of artifact, with short IDs.

The fix is in the bridge: any ID longer than the Atari can hold gets a short stand-in, which the bridge translates back when the Atari asks for that item. That covers every list, not just Artifacts.

The new test fails on the old bridge (a 62-character ID) and passes with the fix. All 39 bridge tests pass. Committing:

Fixed, and the fix is in the bridge only, so you just need to update the Pi.

**Why only the top two worked:** each item in the sidebar list carries an ID, and the Falcon keeps up to 39 characters of it. Artifacts that Claude created as files use the file's full path as their ID, which is longer. The Falcon cut those IDs short, and when you clicked one, the bridge didn't recognise the shortened version, hence "not found". The top two use the older, short IDs, so they worked.

**The fix:** the bridge now gives any ID that's too long a short stand-in that always stays the same for that item. When the Falcon asks for it, the bridge translates it back to the full ID. Short IDs are sent unchanged. The fix applies to every list, not just Artifacts.

I added a test using a long file-path artifact. It fails on the old bridge, which sent a 62-character ID, and passes now. All 39 bridge tests pass.

**On the Pi:**
```sh
cd ~/Atari_claude
git pull
cd pi
sudo ./install.sh
```
Then open **Artifacts** again on the Falcon (Ctrl+R to reconnect isn't needed). Every artifact should open, and **Save to disk…** works for them too. The Falcon program doesn't change this time.

## Erez, 2026-10-03 18:43

Now we need to change the behavior of the top left menu selection just like the lower list selection, on mouse down show highlight

### Claude

The top menu highlights whichever area is active, but that area only changes once the bridge sends the new list back, and Artifacts can take a while to scan. Until then, the old item stayed highlighted. Two changes:

- The item you press highlights immediately on mouse-down and stays highlighted while its list loads.
- **+ New chat**, which isn't an area, shows a pressed highlight while the button is held.

The F1–F5 keys and the menu bar get the same immediate highlight.

Press and hold on "+ New chat", screenshot, then on Projects.

Working as intended. Commit and push:

The top-left menu now highlights on mouse-down, the same way the lower list does. I tested it in Hatari with the demo bridge and pushed it to `whomper/atari_claude` main (`f0d3b2a`).

- **+ New chat:** it highlights as soon as you press the button. When you let go, the highlight goes back to the area you're in.
- **Search, Chats, Projects and Artifacts:** they highlight on press and stay highlighted. Before, the highlight only moved once the Pi sent the new list back, which was most noticeable with Artifacts because it takes a while to load. Now it moves straight away, before the list arrives.
- **F1–F5 keys and the menu bar:** these also move the highlight straight away now.

Only the Atari program changed, so just copy the attached `CLAUDE.PRG` to the Falcon. Nothing needs updating on the Pi.

I added a before-and-after screenshot of the press and release to the repo as `docs/nav-press.png`.

## Erez, 2026-10-03 18:48

Now when selecting Search, the list of recent chats, projects or artifacts should be empty

### Claude

Testing the empty search list in Hatari; checking the screenshots now.

The test in Hatari passed. Committing and pushing:

Selecting **Search** now empties the left list, which shows only an empty **Results** heading until you run a search. I tested it in Hatari with the demo bridge and pushed it to `whomper/atari_claude` main (`680350e`).

- **Clicking Search (or F5 / Ctrl+F):** the recent chats, projects or artifacts disappear, the list is headed **Results**, and the box at the bottom shows **Find:**.
- **Running a search:** type words and press Return. The matching chats appear under **Search: gfa** (or whatever you typed). In the test, "gfa" found "Fix my GFA BASIC loop".
- **A list that arrives late:** if you click Artifacts and then switch to Search before the Pi replies, the Artifacts list no longer appears in the search pane.
- **Leaving search:** Chats, Projects, Artifacts or Esc bring back the normal list.

Only the Atari program changed, so just copy the attached `CLAUDE.PRG` to the Falcon. Nothing needs updating on the Pi.

## Erez, 2026-10-03 19:06

There are artifacts that are not visible in the list, such as 2 cover letters. Perhaps you did not search the right order?

### Claude

I'm reworking how the bridge finds artifacts. It will scan more chats, sort the newest first, and pick up files like cover letters. I'm writing that now.

All 42 tests pass. Now I'll update the README text about artifacts:

Order was part of the problem, but the bigger reason was probably how the cover letters were made. I fixed the bridge for both and pushed it to `whomper/atari_claude` main (`44f82de`). It isn't tested against your real account yet, so check that the two cover letters now appear.

**What was wrong:**
1. **Order:** artifacts were grouped by chat instead of by when Claude made them. The list is now sorted newest first.
2. **How far back it looks:** it only scanned your 40 most recent chats, so a letter in an older chat was missed. It now scans the last 100, and the status line shows "Looking in chat 12 of 100…" while it works. Only new or changed chats are scanned again, so reopening the list stays quick. To look further back, add `--artifact-scan 300` to the bridge's options.
3. **Cover letters were invisible:** a Word cover letter is usually made by a script. The chat only offers the finished file, often as a "View your letter" link, so the bridge never saw it as an artifact. It now picks up those files too:
   - **Opening one** shows the letter's text on the Atari.
   - **Save to disk** saves the real `.docx` file unchanged, suggested as something like `COVER_LE.DOC`.

The bridge's 42 tests pass, including new ones for cover letters, the sort order and scanning past the first 50 chats.

One risk: downloading those files uses an unofficial claude.ai address that I couldn't check. If a letter now shows in the list but gives an error when you open it, that's the cause.

**On the Pi:**
```sh
cd ~/atari_claude && git pull
cd pi && sudo ./install.sh
```

Nothing changes on the Atari.

If the letters still don't appear, run this on the Pi and send me the output. It shows where the chats with "cover" in their title are in your history and which tools and files they use, without any of their text:
```sh
sudo -u claude-st bash -c 'set -a; . /etc/claude-st/claude-st.env; /opt/claude-st/venv/bin/python /opt/claude-st/bridge/claude_bridge.py --probe cover'
```

## Erez, 2026-10-03 19:15

I am getting:
cd pi && sudo ./install.sh
-bash: cd: /home/erez/atari_claude: No such file or directory
-bash: cd: pi: No such file or directory

### Claude

The copy on your Pi isn't in `~/atari_claude`, so `cd` failed. Your first install was probably cloned into `~/claude-st`, from the old YouTube repo.

**1. Find any existing copy:**
```sh
ls -d ~/*/pi/install.sh ~/*/*/pi/install.sh 2>/dev/null
```

**2. Update the Pi from the new repo.** Either way you end up with a fresh copy in `~/atari_claude`:
```sh
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/whomper/atari_claude.git atari_claude
cd ~/atari_claude/pi
sudo ./install.sh
```

The installer keeps your session key and settings in `/etc/claude-st/`, so you won't be asked for the key again. If you had an old copy from the YouTube repo (for example `~/claude-st`), you can delete it afterwards with `rm -rf ~/claude-st`.

**If `git clone` asks for a username and password:** the repo is private, and GitHub no longer accepts your account password here. Make it public on GitHub (Settings → General → Danger Zone → Change visibility) or use a personal access token as the password.

**Next time, to update:**
```sh
cd ~/atari_claude && git pull && cd pi && sudo ./install.sh
```

**To check the new bridge is running:**
```sh
systemctl status claude-st
```

Then open **Artifacts** on the Atari. The status line should count through the chats ("Looking in chat … of 100"), and the cover letters should appear near the top.

## Erez, 2026-10-04 08:53

I need also to find a way to select a Claude model and also its Effort

### Claude

This needs changes on both the Atari and the Pi. I'll look at how the reply line is drawn so I can put a model/effort selector there, the way claude.ai shows it under the input box.

Now the Atari side: a model chip in the reply line, a popup for model and effort, F9 to open it, and the choice saved in CLAUDE.INF.

The Atari side builds. Now the bridge:

Existing tests still pass. Adding tests for the new commands:

The test checked the streamed chunks literally. I'll fix it to reassemble them:

All 46 tests pass. Now I'll try it in Hatari:

The chip shows in the reply line. Now I'll click it:

The menu works. I'll pick Sonnet 5.5, then reopen it and set the effort to Max:

The choice is saved and restored after a restart (top: chosen, bottom: after restarting). Now the docs:

You can now choose the Claude model and its effort from the Atari, and the choice is saved. In Hatari with the demo bridge, choosing a model, changing effort and restoring the choice after a restart all worked. It isn't tested against your real claude.ai account yet. The changes are pushed to `whomper/atari_claude` main (`0486e83`), and the version is now 1.2.

**On the Atari:**
- The right end of the reply line now shows the model and effort in use, for example **Opus 5.5 · Medium**.
- Click it, or press **F9**, to open a menu. The models are listed first, then the effort levels for the chosen model, with the current ones ticked.
- Models: Opus 5.5, Fable 5.1, Sonnet 5.5, Haiku 4.5, Opus 5, Opus 4.8.
- Effort levels: Low, Medium, High, Extra high, Max. Haiku 4.5 has no effort setting, so those items disappear when it's selected.
- Your choice is saved in `CLAUDE.INF` (a line like `model claude-sonnet-5-5 max`) and applied again each time Claude ST connects to the Pi.

**With your claude.ai account:**
- **Model:** the menu starts on **Default model**, which is your account's own choice. Picking another model asks claude.ai for it; if your plan doesn't include that model, the error shows in the chat.
- **Effort:** claude.ai has no documented effort setting, so this part is a guess. The bridge asks for it anyway. If claude.ai refuses, it sends the message without it and says so at the top of the reply. So effort may make no difference on claude.ai.

**With the Anthropic API backend,** both settings are fully supported and sent with every message.

The bridge's 46 tests pass, including new ones for the model menu, invalid choices and what's sent to the API.

**To update:**
- **Falcon:** copy the attached `CLAUDE.PRG` over the old one and keep your `CLAUDE.INF`.
- **Pi:**
  ```sh
  cd ~/atari_claude && git pull && cd pi && sudo ./install.sh
  ```
  If you still have only the old copy, clone the repo first as in my previous message.

Update both. The new Atari program needs the new bridge to show the model chip.

## Erez, 2026-10-04 09:08

I also want the option to see:

1. What plan I am currently at
2. What is the current usage and when it will reset
3. My account info

### Claude

I'll look at what the bridge and the Atari already have for showing a page like this:

I'll add an **Account** page: plan, usage bars with reset times, and account details. It opens from the Options menu, `F8`, or by clicking the status line. Bridge first:

The bridge side works. Now the Atari menu item, the `F8` key, and clicking the status line:

`tx_cmd` handles the missing fields. Now tests for the account page:

Tests pass. Checking it in Hatari by clicking the status line:

It works, but the bar wraps on a narrow screen and splits "37%" onto its own line. I'll put each limit's name, bar and reset time on separate lines:

Now the page reads cleanly, and `F8` opens it too. Updating the docs, then committing:

I added an **Account** page that shows your plan, usage with reset times, and account details. It works in Hatari with the demo bridge, but I haven't tried it against your real claude.ai account. The changes are pushed to `whomper/atari_claude` main (`dd72dc6`), and the version is now 1.3.

**Opening it:** click the status line at the bottom left, choose **Options ▸ Account…**, or press **F8**. The page appears in the chat area with three sections:

1. **Plan:** Free, Pro, Max (5x or 20x usage), Team or Enterprise.
2. **Usage:** a meter for each limit, such as the current 5-hour session and this week's usage, for example:
   ```
   Current session (5 hours)
     [#######-------------] 37%
     resets in 2 h 13 min (Sun 4 Oct, 11:24)
   ```
   Reset times are in the Pi's time zone.
3. **Account:** your name, email, organization and the date you joined.

**The risk with your real account:** this uses the same unofficial claude.ai addresses as the rest of the bridge, and these two (account and usage) are new ones I couldn't check. The plan name is my reading of what claude.ai returns. If the plan looks wrong, or the page says "claude.ai did not report your usage", run this on the Pi so I can see what came back:
```sh
journalctl -u claude-st -n 30
```

With the API backend instead of claude.ai, the page shows the tokens used since the Pi bridge started, because the API has no plan or usage limits to report.

The bridge's 50 tests pass, including new ones for the plan names, usage meters and reset times.

**To update:**
- **Falcon:** copy the attached `CLAUDE.PRG` over the old one.
- **Pi:**
  ```sh
  cd ~/atari_claude && git pull && cd pi && sudo ./install.sh
  ```

## Erez, 2026-10-04 13:24

The model selector, while looking great, takes space from the edit field. Also, It is different per each chat or project. First, can you see if you can figure it out per chat?

### Claude

Two changes: move the model chip out of the reply line into the chat's title bar, and have each chat show and use its own model. I'll look at how the title bar is drawn and what claude.ai stores with each chat:

Now I'll move the chip into the title bar:

The chip is now in the title bar. Next, the bridge: each chat's own model, read from the chat when it's opened:

That failure is in the test, not the bridge: the chip already shows that model, so no update is needed. I'll fix the test to open another chat first:

Now in Hatari: the chip in the title bar, then switching between chats with different models:

The chip moved, but my second and third clicks don't seem to have landed. I'll check where the pointer actually is:

The pointer didn't move. That's a known problem with the emulated mouse, not the app. I'll retry with smaller movements:

The emulator's input has gone wrong: the mouse isn't moving and stray characters are being typed. I'll restart it and use the keyboard instead (Tab and Return to open chats, F9 for the menu):

I've done both: the model chip is out of the reply line, and each chat now shows and uses its own model. I tested it in Hatari with the demo bridge, but not against your real claude.ai account. The changes are pushed to `whomper/atari_claude` main (`8fd1091`), and the version is now 1.4.

**The chip:** it now sits at the right end of the chat's title bar (for example **Fix my GFA BASIC loop … [Sonnet 4]**), and the reply line has its full width back. Click it, or press F9, and the menu opens just below it. On a narrow window the chip hides itself rather than squeeze the title.

**Per chat:**
- **Opening a chat** switches the chip to that chat's model, which the bridge reads from claude.ai when the chat loads. Older models no longer offered, such as Sonnet 4, get a proper name and are added to the menu. They have no effort levels, so none are shown.
- **Changing the model in an open chat** changes it for that chat, and it also becomes the model for your next new chats.
- **New chats, and old chats with no model recorded,** use the model you picked last. That choice is still saved in `CLAUDE.INF`.

**Effort on claude.ai:** the effort setting is kept per chat on the Pi only, so it lasts until the bridge restarts. I couldn't find where claude.ai stores it, if anywhere.

The bridge's 54 tests pass, including new ones for switching between chats and model names.

**Projects:** I haven't done these yet. I'm not sure claude.ai stores a model for each project the way it does for each chat. If it does, the next step would be for chats in a project to start on that project's model.

**To update:**
- **Falcon:** copy the attached `CLAUDE.PRG` over the old one.
- **Pi:**
  ```sh
  cd ~/atari_claude && git pull && cd pi && sudo ./install.sh
  ```

## Erez, 2026-10-04 13:30

Yes, each chat has its own model. Have you figured out how to retrieve and set that?

### Claude

Not for certain. The code is written but untested, because I can't reach your claude.ai account. Here's what it relies on:

- **Retrieving:** when a chat opens, the bridge reads the `model` field from the chat's data on claude.ai. I believe the claude.ai web app keeps a chat's model there, but I haven't confirmed it with your account.
- **Setting:** when you pick a model, the bridge asks claude.ai to save it on the chat. Each message you send also names the model. Both are guesses at the website's unofficial interface.

I'll make the Pi's probe command report each chat's model, so you can check the retrieving part:

The probe change is pushed (`2719c7b`) and all bridge tests pass. To check it against your account, update the Pi and run the probe. Use a word from the title of a chat whose model you know, for example `gfa`:

```sh
cd ~/atari_claude && git pull && cd pi && sudo ./install.sh
sudo -u claude-st bash -c 'set -a; . /etc/claude-st/claude-st.env; /opt/claude-st/venv/bin/python /opt/claude-st/bridge/claude_bridge.py --probe gfa'
```

Each matching chat prints lines like:
```
chat #7: Fix my GFA BASIC loop (updated 2026-09-30T...)
    model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514'  settings: [...]
```

It shows only the model and settings fields, not anything you wrote in the chat. Paste the output here.

- **If it shows the right model:** reading works as built. Then for the setting part: open that chat on the Atari, change the model, and look at the chat on claude.ai in a browser. If the browser shows the new model, setting works too.
- **If it shows `model: None`:** claude.ai keeps the model somewhere else. The `settings` part and the "model fields in the chat list" line should show where, and I'll switch the bridge to it.

## Erez, 2026-10-04 13:35

This seems to work ok. Can you make the model selection area and text smaller so that there is more room for the title?

### Claude

The VDI call returns the small font's cell size, so I'll draw the chip in the smaller system font: 8×8 in ST high, 6×6 in medium. I'll also shorten the effort names on the chip:

Now I'll check it in ST high and ST medium:

That's much smaller in ST high. Now ST medium:

It works in ST medium too, with the 6×6 font. I'll update the screenshot in the README and commit:

The model chip is now smaller, so the title gets more of the title bar. I checked it in Hatari in ST high and ST medium and pushed it to `whomper/atari_claude` main (`60c5204`).

- **Smaller text:** the chip now uses the Atari's small system font, 8×8 in ST high and 6×6 in ST medium, with a thinner box.
- **Shorter labels:** Medium shows as **Med**, Extra high as **XHigh**, and "Default model" as **Default**. The menu still shows the full names.

In ST high, "Opus 5.5 · Medium" used to take about 21 title characters; it now takes about 12. In ST medium the 6×6 text is small but readable.

Only the Atari program changed, so just copy the attached `CLAUDE.PRG` to the Falcon. Nothing needs updating on the Pi.

## Erez, 2026-10-04 13:40

Can you generate a tooltip whenever the mouse stops for some time over a text area that does not display all the text, such as left chat, projects, artifacts are and the main chat/project title ?
Also, when clicking on Artifacts and while the artifacts are being retrieved, the recent or projects list area should be cleared.
Lastly, the bottom left area where it states the connection status with Claude.ai should not reflect messages coming in, for example when I change a model it shows the selected model

### Claude

Three changes: tooltips for cut-off text, clearing the list while it loads, and keeping the status line for connection status only. First I'll see what the bridge currently sends to the status line:

I have what I need. Now the Atari side:

Now the tooltip, and expiring notices in the main loop:

Builds cleanly. Now the bridge: notices go out as `N`, and the status line gets only the connection state:

My first edit missed the function definition, so nothing was written. Redoing it:

Tests pass. I'll add one making sure the status line only ever gets connection lines:

Now in Hatari, with a demo bridge whose artifact search is slowed down so the loading state is visible:

That killed my own shell: the restart script's process-kill pattern matched text in my command. I'll run the steps separately:

It's running. The kill pattern also matched my own command text that time. Continuing:

Now the tooltip. I'll rest the mouse on "Ideas for a demoscene intro", which is cut off in the list:

The tooltip appears. Next I'll move to another cut-off item to check the first tooltip is cleaned up:

Tooltips are removed cleanly when the mouse moves. Now the chat title. I'll send a long message so the new chat gets a long title:

The title tooltip works. The tooltip ends at "falcon dsp" only because the demo bridge cuts titles at 40 characters. Updating the docs and committing:

All three are done and pushed to `whomper/atari_claude` main (`1498a24`); the version is now 1.5. I tested each one in Hatari with the demo bridge, and the bridge's 55 tests pass, including a new one that checks the status line only ever shows the connection.

**1. Tooltips.** If you rest the mouse for about 0.6 seconds on text that is cut off, a small box shows the whole text. This works on:
- chats, projects and artifacts in the sidebar list, including Hebrew names;
- the list heading;
- the chat or project title in the title bar.

The tooltip disappears as soon as you move the mouse, press a key or click. It appears only when the text is actually cut off, and not when a desk accessory window is in front.

**2. The list clears while loading.** Clicking **Chats**, **Projects** or **Artifacts** empties the list immediately and shows *Loading...* until the new list arrives. For Artifacts it shows the progress instead, for example *Scanning chat 5/40*.

**3. The status line shows only the connection.** It now shows just *Connecting…*, *Online: claude.ai*, *Offline: …* or *Not signed in to claude.ai*. Short progress messages like *Loading chat...*, or *Renamed* after a rename, appear in grey at the right of the title bar for a few seconds. They only appear if they fit completely. Changing the model no longer shows any message.

**To update:**
- **Falcon:** copy the attached `CLAUDE.PRG` over the old one.
- **Pi:** this needs the new bridge too, for the status line change:
  ```sh
  cd ~/atari_claude && git pull && cd pi && sudo ./install.sh
  ```

## Erez, 2026-10-04 14:38

There is something strange in the Usage info. A text "Iguana necktie" that is reset in 31d and 17h
I do not find it in the normal web interface

### Claude

"Iguana necktie" isn't a real limit. claude.ai's usage data includes an entry under the internal name `iguana_necktie`, which the website doesn't display. My code showed every entry it didn't recognise, turning the underscore name into "Iguana necktie". I'll change it to show only the limits the website shows and log anything else on the Pi:

I've fixed it on the bridge side. "Iguana necktie" is no longer shown on the Account page, and the fix is pushed to `whomper/atari_claude` main (`6579faa`).

**What it was:** claude.ai sends a list of usage entries. Besides your real limits, it includes internal entries under made-up code names such as `iguana_necktie`, which its own website hides. My code showed every entry it didn't recognise, turning `iguana_necktie` into the name "Iguana necktie". Its 31-day reset date is just part of that internal entry and has nothing to do with your plan.

**The fix:** the Account page now shows only the limits claude.ai's Usage page shows:
- the current 5-hour session;
- this week, for all models, Opus, Sonnet, and Claude Code and apps;
- extra usage, if you've turned it on.

Anything else is written to the Pi's log instead of being shown. The tests now include an `iguana_necktie` entry to make sure it stays hidden. Please compare the page with claude.ai's Usage page once you've updated, since I can't see your real data.

**Update only the Pi.** The Atari program is unchanged.
```sh
cd ~/atari_claude && git pull && cd pi && sudo ./install.sh
```

To see what was hidden:
```sh
journalctl -u claude-st | grep "not shown"
```

## Erez, 2026-10-04 14:40

I think it is related to a special promotion or credit as I see:

Cloud session credits
Applies automatically to cloud sessions. After it’s used or expires, your plan’s regular usage applies.
Included credit
Expires 9:59 AM GMT+2, November 5
$9 of $100 left

### Claude

That fits: "expires November 5" is 31 days and 17 hours from today, exactly what the Atari showed. So `iguana_necktie` is claude.ai's internal name for your **Cloud session credits**. I'll show it again under that name, with "expires" instead of "resets". I'll also log the raw entry on the Pi, so we can see whether it includes the dollar amounts:

You're right: "Iguana necktie" is your **Cloud session credits**. Its expiry, November 5 at 9:59 AM your time, is exactly 31 days and 17 hours from today, which is what the Atari showed. So it was real, and my last change hid it. The Account page now shows it properly. The change is pushed to `whomper/atari_claude` main (`c1e2155`), and the bridge's 55 tests pass.

```
Cloud session credits
  [##################--] 91% used
  expires in 31 d 17 h (Wed 5 Nov, 09:59)
```

- **Name:** `iguana_necktie` is claude.ai's internal name for that credit, and the bridge now shows it as "Cloud session credits".
- **Expires:** it says "expires" rather than "resets", because a credit runs out rather than renewing.
- **"used":** all the meters now say "used" (for example "91% used"), so it's clear what the percentage measures.

**Not done yet:** the dollar amounts ("$9 of $100 left"). I don't yet know which fields hold them, and I'd rather not show a wrong figure. The bridge now writes the raw credit entry to the Pi's log. If you send me the output of the second command below, I can add the amounts.

**Update only the Pi.** The Atari program is unchanged.
```sh
cd ~/atari_claude && git pull && cd pi && sudo ./install.sh
```
Open the Account page on the Atari (F8), then on the Pi run:
```sh
journalctl -u claude-st | grep "iguana_necktie ="
```

## Erez, 2026-10-04 14:41

Also, in the Account info, there are the texts: Info, then Plan and the plan and then usage. The First Info text is redundant and we can just have Plan and Usage sections plus the Account section at the bottom

### Claude

The "Info" heading is the label the Atari puts above every info message. I'll add a message type with no label and use it for the Account page:

Checking it in Hatari:

The Account page no longer has the "Info" label. It starts with **Plan**, then **Usage**, then **Account** at the bottom. I checked it in Hatari with the demo bridge and pushed it to `whomper/atari_claude` main (`87850e0`); the version is now 1.6.

The Atari adds that label to every info message, so the bridge now sends the Account page as a new kind of message that has no label.

This needs both updates. If only one side is updated, the page shows "Claude" as its label instead of "Info".
- **Falcon:** copy the attached `CLAUDE.PRG` over the old one.
- **Pi:**
  ```sh
  cd ~/atari_claude && git pull && cd pi && sudo ./install.sh
  ```

## Erez, 2026-10-04 14:44

In the Account Usage section, have an empty line separating each usage type, thus separate the Current session info from This weeks one from the cloud session one

### Claude

I added a pointless line to the test by mistake. Removing it:

The Usage section now has a blank line between each limit, as in the bridge's test output:

```
Usage
Current session (5 hours)
  [########------------] 42% used
  resets in 2 h 13 min (Sun 4 Oct, 16:56)

This week, all models
  [##------------------] 10% used
  resets in 3 d 4 h (Wed 7 Oct, 19:42)

Cloud session credits
  [##################--] 91% used
  expires in 31 d 17 h (Wed 5 Nov, 09:59)
```

The bridge's 55 tests pass, and the change is pushed to `whomper/atari_claude` main (`97e3df6`). Only the Pi needs updating; the Atari program is unchanged:

```sh
cd ~/atari_claude && git pull && cd pi && sudo ./install.sh
```

## Erez, 2026-10-04 14:45

Ah, I thought the program needs updating but I understand that it just shows the Pi

### Claude

Yes. The Account page's wording and layout come from the Pi. The Atari just displays the lines the Pi sends, so a change like this blank line only needs the Pi update.

**Pi only:** changes to what a page says or how it's laid out, such as the usage limits, the blank lines, the artifact search, which models are offered, or how claude.ai is contacted. Run `git pull` and `sudo ./install.sh` on the Pi.

**New `CLAUDE.PRG` for the Falcon:** anything the Atari draws or handles itself, such as the model chip, tooltips, the menus, the keyboard, or a new kind of message (like the label-free Account page in 1.6).

When I send you a new `CLAUDE.PRG`, I'll also say whether the Pi needs updating.

## Erez, 2026-10-04 14:46

Now I am not seeing the Code section chats of claude.ai. Can that be presented as well? Just have Code as a menu entry right after Chats and it should behave the same as chats and projects

### Claude

Code sessions on claude.ai are stored separately from regular chats, so the bridge needs a new source. First I'll see how the Atari handles the list types:

The Atari side builds. Now the bridge: a Code list, opening a session, sending to it, and rename/archive:

Existing tests pass. Now tests for the Code sessions, and a `--probe-code` option for the Pi:

That's the test's mistake again: with the Code list showing, a new chat correctly doesn't refresh the Chats list. I'll check that a new chat was created instead:

Now in Hatari: the menu with Code, the Code list, and opening a session:

Opening a session works. One thing to tidy: the model chip appears on a Code session, where it doesn't apply, so I'll hide it there:

Sending to a session works, and the chip is gone there. Updating the docs and committing:

I've added **Code** to the menu, right after **Chats** (or press **F6**). It works in Hatari with the demo bridge, but I haven't been able to try it against your real claude.ai account. The changes are pushed to `whomper/atari_claude` main (`9095d2b`), and the version is now 1.7.

It behaves like Chats:
- **List:** your Claude Code sessions, newest first. While the list loads, the sidebar shows *Loading...*.
- **Open a session:** you see your messages and Claude's replies. Each tool call Claude made is shown as a one-line note, such as `[Bash: make -C st]`; the tool output itself is left out.
- **Reply:** type below and the message goes to that session. Claude Code's replies appear as it works. If it's still working after 15 minutes, the Atari stops waiting; open the session again later to see the rest.
- **Right-click:** Open, Rename… and Archive. Code sessions on claude.ai have no Pin or Move to project.
- **New chat** takes you back to a normal chat.
- **Model chip:** hidden while a session is open, because a session runs on its own model.

**What might not work:** claude.ai keeps Code sessions in a separate store from chats, with a different unofficial interface. I built the bridge on my understanding of that interface, but I couldn't try it on your account. If Code shows an error or an empty list, run this on the Pi and send me the output. It shows only session titles and counts:
```sh
sudo -u claude-st bash -c 'set -a; . /etc/claude-st/claude-st.env; /opt/claude-st/venv/bin/python /opt/claude-st/bridge/claude_bridge.py --probe-code'
```

The bridge's 58 tests pass, including new ones for listing, reading and replying to sessions.

**To update:** this needs both.
- **Falcon:** copy the attached `CLAUDE.PRG` over the old one.
- **Pi:**
  ```sh
  cd ~/atari_claude && git pull && cd pi && sudo ./install.sh
  ```

## Erez, 2026-10-04 14:53

IT seems to work. I need the model selection at the top right just like projects and chats

### Claude

I'll show the chip on Code sessions too. Each session has its own model, which I expect claude.ai to report in the session's details. Picking a model on a session will ask claude.ai to switch that session's model.

The chip shows the session's model (Sonnet 5.5), and the menu opens from it. I'll remove the now-unused hiding code, update the README and commit:

Code sessions now have the model chip at the top right, like chats and projects. In Hatari with the demo bridge, opening a session showed its model and the menu worked. The changes are pushed to `whomper/atari_claude` main (`f5c8e10`), and the version is now 1.8. The bridge's 58 tests pass, including new ones for a session's model.

- **Opening a session** shows that session's own model, read from claude.ai.
- **Picking a model** asks claude.ai to switch that session to it. Unlike in a chat, this doesn't change the model for your new chats.
- **No model recorded:** the chip shows the model you use for new chats.

**Not checked against your account:** I had to guess how claude.ai accepts a model change for a running session. Please check after updating. Open a Code session and look at its chip. Then switch its model and look at the same session on claude.ai/code. If claude.ai refuses the change, the Atari says so in the session, and I'll need the exact message.

**To update:** this needs both.
- **Falcon:** copy the attached `CLAUDE.PRG` over the old one.
- **Pi:**
  ```sh
  cd ~/atari_claude && git pull && cd pi && sudo ./install.sh
  ```

## Erez, 2026-10-04 15:15

I am now looking to post this project in Atariage.com and atari-forum.com web site and promote it as I think there is no clear Claude.ai application on Atari ST.
Build the right text for me that showcases it

### Claude

I'll put both posts on one page with copy buttons: a BBCode version for atari-forum.com and a plain-text version for AtariAge, which doesn't take BBCode reliably.

I wrote the announcement and put it on a private page with copy buttons: https://claude.ai/artifact/MP1JGEDgHrEskpzfR93Qii

The page has two versions of the same post, plus two title options:
- **atari-forum.com:** BBCode, the formatting tags its boards use, for headings, lists, code and screenshots.
- **AtariAge:** plain text with bullet points, because its editor doesn't take BBCode reliably. Add the screenshots with its image button.

The post covers:
- why you wrote it: you couldn't find a proper Claude.ai app for the Atari;
- how it works: no cables, the Falcon on WiFi through STinG, with the Pi doing the HTTPS;
- the feature list;
- requirements: TOS 1.0 to 4.x, 640×200 or more, about 250 KB of free RAM, STinG or a serial cable, a Pi or any computer with Python 3, a claude.ai account or API key;
- the GitHub link;
- a short note that it's unofficial and uses claude.ai's private interface.

That note matters on these forums: if something breaks when claude.ai changes, people will have been warned.

I avoided calling it "the first Claude client for the Atari", because someone may have tried before. "I couldn't find a proper way to use Claude.ai from an Atari, so I wrote one" makes the same point without inviting an argument.

The page ends with a checklist. The points that matter most:
1. **Make `whomper/atari_claude` public on GitHub.** Otherwise readers can't download it and the image links won't show.
2. **Take fresh screenshots.** Some images in the repository's `docs` folder come from early versions.
3. **Add a photo of your Falcon running it.** On a retro forum, real hardware gets far more attention than screenshots.
4. **Consider saying it was built with Claude Code's help.** One line answers the question before someone asks it. It's your call.
5. **Make a GitHub release.** A ZIP with `CLAUDE.PRG`, `CLAUDE.INF` and the icon files is easier to download than browsing the repository.

## Erez, 2026-10-04 15:22

Revise the text to state it was code with claude.ai, coding an application to access claude.ai, which is a nice anecdote ....

### Claude

I'll add a short "how it was made" section to both versions, and a third title option built on that angle:

I've updated both posts on the same page: https://claude.ai/artifact/MP1JGEDgHrEskpzfR93Qii

**Opening line,** so readers know the story is coming:
> I couldn't find a proper way to use Claude.ai from an Atari, so I made one, with Claude's help (more on that below).

**New "How it was made" section,** just before the download link:
> Here's the fun part: Claude ST was written with Claude. I built it with Claude Code on claude.ai. I described what I wanted and tested every version on my Falcon, and Claude wrote the 68000 C code, the bridge and the Pi installer, and tested each change in Hatari before handing it over. So Claude wrote the program that lets an Atari talk to Claude. The Code section in the sidebar can even open the very session it was written in.

It credits you with the design and the testing on real hardware, which is accurate and tends to go down well on retro forums. The last sentence is literally true: this conversation is a claude.ai Code session, so it appears in the app's Code list.

**New title option** based on the twist: *Claude ST: a Claude.ai client for the Atari, written with Claude*.

**Checklist:** instead of the old "say it was built with AI help" point, it now suggests a photo of the Falcon showing this session open in the Code section. Expect questions about AI-written code; since the source is public, people can judge it for themselves.

## Erez, 2026-10-04 15:39

I am reading the GitHub readme and find a few challenges there:

1. Is the hardcoding access to 192.168.68.129 configurable ? It should be and the readme should reflect it
2. There are many images that are out of date. They all should be refreshed
3. The readme is long. Can it be made shorter and more precise? At least the setup with clear commands to paste in terminal

### Claude

I'll start by finding every place the two addresses appear in the code and docs:

The syntax checks out. The installer needs root and systemd, so I'll test the new address handling on its own:

The address handling works: one address, several, `any`, and rejecting a bad one. Now the repository's `CLAUDE.INF` becomes an example with a comment; the Atari ignores lines it doesn't recognise:

I'll refresh every screenshot from the current version in Hatari: ST high for most, STE medium colour for a project view, and a TT colour mode for the colour About box. First the ST high set:

Escape didn't close the model menu, so the third screenshot shows the menu again instead of the right-click menu. I'll check whether that's my test input or the app:

The menu ignores Escape and Space. I'll check whether it reacts to the arrow keys:

Arrow keys work. The problem is my test input: Hatari reads a single-digit key code such as `1` (Escape) as the character "1". I'll send Escape in hex instead:

Escape works when sent in hex, so the app is fine. I'll script the full set of ST high screenshots, with the pointer moved out of the way:

Most are good. Two need redoing: the Hebrew shot opened the wrong chat (one Tab too few), and the pointer drifted onto an item that isn't cut off, so no tooltip appeared:

The cursor reached the Hebrew chat, but Return didn't open it. The pointer also landed one row too high again, so I'll correct for that:

Both are right now. Next, the colour screenshots: STE medium inside a project, and the colour About box on a TT:

Good. Now the TT colour About box:

All screenshots are done. Now the README itself. I'll see its current structure:

Now I'll write the new README: short, with the setup as commands to paste. The detailed feature descriptions move to a separate user guide, `docs/GUIDE.md`, so nothing is lost:

I'll keep the icon at the top. Writing the new README:

The README is down from 545 lines to about 165. Now the user guide. I'll pull the detailed sections from the old README:

I'll check a few claims in the guide against the code:

The installer only replaces its own settings, so `CLAUDE_ST_EXTRA` survives updates. Now I'll copy in the new screenshots and remove the ones the docs no longer use:

Only the old press-highlight screenshot is unused now; I'll remove it and change the last stray address in a test. Then the tests, the build and the commit:

The tests pass. The chain stopped only because `make` had nothing to rebuild, so my output filter matched nothing. I'll continue without it:

All three points are addressed and pushed to `whomper/atari_claude` main (`4fef64e`). The bridge's 58 tests pass. I couldn't run the installer itself here, because it needs root on a real Linux machine, but I tested its new address handling separately.

**1. Addresses.** Nothing in the program logic was hardcoded; your two addresses appeared only as examples and in your own settings file. They're now neutral examples, 192.168.1.10 for the Pi and 192.168.1.20 for the Atari:
- **Pi's address:** set in `CLAUDE.INF`, or by typing `/connect` in the reply line. The repository's `CLAUDE.INF` is now an example with a comment saying where to put the address. The Atari's alert boxes no longer show your real address.
- **Atari's address:** set with `install.sh --atari`. If you leave it out, the installer now asks for it. It also accepts several addresses (`--atari 192.168.1.20,192.168.1.21`) or `--atari any` for any address on your network.
- **The README** explains both, using the example addresses.

**2. Screenshots.** All of them are retaken from the current version in Hatari:
- the main window in ST high;
- a project in STE medium colour;
- the model menu, the right-click menu, the Account page, a Code session and a tooltip;
- new screenshots of a Hebrew chat and of a right-click menu;
- the About box in mono, and in colour on a TT.

The unused screenshot is removed. They use the demo bridge, so they show sample chats and "Online: demo"; the guide says so.

**3. Shorter README.** It's down from 545 lines to about 165:
- what Claude ST is, its features, and how it works in one line;
- what you need;
- setup in three steps with commands to paste (session key, Pi, Atari);
- serial cable and API key alternatives;
- a table of Pi maintenance commands, a key table, the unofficial-client note and the "written with Claude" line.

The setup also fixes a wrong clone address: the old README still pointed at the YouTube repository. All the details moved to a new user guide, `docs/GUIDE.md`, with a table of contents, a troubleshooting section, and the developer material: building, Hatari and source layout.

**Extra bridge options now survive updates.** An option such as `--artifact-scan 300` used to be lost whenever the installer ran. It now goes on a separate line of the Pi's settings file, which the installer leaves alone.

**To update:**
- **Pi:** run `git pull && sudo ./install.sh` in `~/atari_claude/pi` to pick up the installer and service changes.
- **Falcon:** keep your current `CLAUDE.INF`. The repository's copy now holds the example address 192.168.1.10, which won't reach your Pi. Updating `CLAUDE.PRG` is optional; only the alert box examples changed.

## Erez, 2026-10-04 15:55

Are the chats stored in the Pi or always streamed directly from claude.ai?

### Claude

I'll check what the bridge writes to disk and to its log:

With your claude.ai account, nothing is stored on the Pi. Every time you open a list or a chat, the bridge fetches it fresh from claude.ai and passes it straight on to the Atari. Your chats live only on claude.ai, so anything you do on the Atari shows up on the website and vice versa.

**Kept in the Pi's memory only, and lost when the bridge restarts:**
- **Artifacts:** the artifacts found in your recent chats, so that reopening the Artifacts list is quick.
- **Effort setting** you picked for each chat.
- **Your place in each open Code session,** so it only asks for the newest messages.
- **Short stand-in names** the Atari uses for very long artifact names.

**Stored on disk on the Pi:**
- **Settings** in `/etc/claude-st/claude-st.env`: your session key and the bridge's options, readable only by root and the bridge.
- **Log** (`journalctl -u claude-st`): connections, errors, model changes and usage figures, but not what you or Claude write. The bridge can also log every line it sends, chat text included, but only if started with `-v`. The installed service doesn't use it.

**The Anthropic API backend works differently.** There's no claude.ai account behind it, so the bridge itself stores the chats, one file per chat, in `/var/lib/claude-st/chats/` on the Pi.

**On the Atari,** the open conversation exists only in memory while Claude ST runs. The only files it writes are `CLAUDE.INF` (settings) and artifacts you choose to save to disk.

## Erez, 2026-10-04 15:56

You stated "Kept in the Pi's memory only, and lost when the bridge restarts:". What if the Pi never restarts?

### Claude

I'll check exactly what the bridge holds in memory and whether any of it is ever cleared:

With the claude.ai backend, a few things would just keep growing, and some would go out of date. While checking, I also found that part of my last answer was wrong.

**Correction:** the effort setting is *not* remembered per chat with claude.ai. I said it was kept in the Pi's memory, but the bridge only asks claude.ai to save the chat's model, and claude.ai doesn't store effort. Opening a chat therefore shows that chat's model with whatever effort you used last. Only the API backend stores effort with each chat.

**What happens if the bridge runs for months:**

| Kept in memory | Grows? | Out of date? |
|---|---|---|
| Artifacts found in your chats (their text) | Yes. Artifacts from new chats are added, and nothing is ever removed. | **Yes.** If you delete a chat on claude.ai, its artifacts stay in the Atari's Artifacts list until the bridge restarts. |
| Word and other files you opened or saved from Artifacts | Yes. Each downloaded file stays in memory. | No |
| The list of chats already scanned for artifacts | Yes, one small entry per chat | No: a chat is scanned again whenever it changes |
| Stand-in names for long artifact names | Yes, a few bytes each | No |
| Your place in the open Code session | No: only one is kept | No |

**How much memory:** artifacts are mostly text, so even after months it would likely be a few megabytes, plus any Word or PDF files you've opened, against the Pi's gigabyte or more. It won't crash the Pi, but it never stops growing.

**The real issue is staleness:** artifacts from chats you've deleted stay listed until the bridge restarts, which you'd otherwise only get from a reboot or an update.

**Fixes I can make:**
1. Each time the Artifacts list loads, drop artifacts whose chats are gone or no longer among the chats scanned. This keeps memory bounded and the list accurate.
2. Release a downloaded file's contents from memory once it has been sent to the Atari.
3. Remember the effort for each chat on the Pi, in a small file that survives restarts. This would make my earlier claim true.

Shall I do all three?

## Erez, 2026-10-04 16:00

Yes and make sure to reflect in readme so that it is correct

### Claude

I'll check where the bridge is allowed to write on the Pi:

`/var/lib/claude-st` is the bridge's own writable folder, so the remembered effort settings will go there. Implementing all three:

The existing tests pass. One gap: a new chat's effort is only remembered if you change it later. I'll also store it when the chat is first created:

Now tests for each fix: pruning, releasing downloaded files, and the remembered effort surviving a restart:

All 62 tests pass. Now the docs, so they describe the new behaviour accurately:

The docs now match the code. I'll add one detail to the log entry (it also records usage figures), then commit:

The push was refused because GitHub has commits I don't have, probably edits you made on the website. I'll look at them before merging:

That's your edit on GitHub, changing the copyright line to "© 2026 Whomper". It doesn't overlap my changes, so I'll put my commit on top of it and push:

All three fixes are in, and the README and user guide now describe them accurately. They're pushed to `whomper/atari_claude` main (`b59879d`), and the bridge's 62 tests pass, including four new ones for these fixes.

1. **Deleted chats leave the Artifacts list.** Each time the list loads, the bridge forgets chats that were deleted on claude.ai or are no longer among the 100 most recent, along with their artifacts. The list stays accurate and memory stays bounded, however long the Pi runs.
2. **Downloaded files aren't kept.** A file Claude made with a script, such as a Word document, is downloaded from claude.ai when you open or save it. The bridge lets go of it once it has been shown or sent to the Atari. Saving now downloads the file once instead of twice.
3. **The effort is remembered for each chat and Code session.** It's kept in `/var/lib/claude-st/chat-effort.json` on the Pi, so it survives restarts and reboots. The file keeps the 500 most recent entries. A new chat's effort is recorded when the chat is created, and a chat with nothing recorded uses the effort you chose last.

**Docs:** the user guide has a new **What is stored where** table: claude.ai, each file on the Pi, the bridge's memory, the log and the Atari. The README has a short version under "Good to know", and its API backend section now names the folder where chats are stored.

**Your edit on GitHub:** you'd changed the README's last line to "© 2026 Whomper". My push was refused until I brought that in, so your change is kept. The About box on the Atari still says "© 2026 Erez Yaary". Should it say Whomper too, or stay as it is?

**To update:** only the Pi needs it.
```sh
cd ~/atari_claude/pi && git pull && sudo ./install.sh
```

## Erez, 2026-10-04 16:06

Yes, change to Whomper

### Claude

Only the About box mentions it in the program. I'll change its © line to Whomper, keep "Created by Erez Yaary" as you originally asked, bump the version to 1.9, and retake the About screenshots:

The About box now says **© 2026 Whomper**, and the version is 1.9. I checked it in Hatari in mono and colour, retook both About screenshots for the docs, and pushed everything to `whomper/atari_claude` main (`8eaa5a9`).

The "Created by Erez Yaary" line above it is unchanged, since that's the name you originally asked for. If you'd like that line to say Whomper too, or to be removed, I can change it.

Only the Atari program changed, so just copy the attached `CLAUDE.PRG` to the Falcon. Nothing needs updating on the Pi.

## Erez, 2026-10-04 16:10

I see an issue with the code model. It does not select strength for Sonnet 5 and when I have an Opus 5.5 High, it selects Med.  Review this also for chats and projects to see if it happens there as well

### Claude

I'll look at how the bridge decides which effort levels a model has, and where it reads a chat's or session's effort:

All 66 tests pass. I'll make the Pi's probes show where claude.ai keeps the effort, so you can confirm it on your account:

The About box is back to Erez Yaary, and the version is now 1.10. Retaking the About screenshots, then updating the guide's effort section:

I fixed both problems, and they affected chats and project chats as well as Code sessions. The About box is back to "© 2026 Erez Yaary", and the version is now 1.10. Everything is pushed to `whomper/atari_claude` main (`d0c391c`), and the bridge's 66 tests pass, including new ones for both problems.

**1. Sonnet 5 had no effort levels.** The bridge's list of which models accept an effort setting left out Sonnet 5, Opus 4.7 and a few others. It also didn't recognise a model name with a suffix, such as `[1m]` or a date, so for those it offered no effort menu. Every current model family now gets its effort levels, and Opus 5.5[1m] now shows as "Opus 5.5".

**2. Opus 5.5 High showed Med.** The bridge never read the effort from claude.ai. For Code sessions it didn't look at all, and for chats it looked in just one guessed place. With nothing found, the chip showed the effort from the chat you'd opened before, or Opus 5.5's default, which is Medium. Now, for each chat, project chat or Code session, the effort shown is:
1. the effort claude.ai has for it, wherever it stores it in the chat's or session's details;
2. otherwise, the effort you last chose for it on the Atari, which the Pi remembers;
3. otherwise, the model's default.

**Not yet checked:** I can't see exactly where claude.ai stores the effort, so the bridge searches the chat's and session's details for any field whose name contains "effort". If your Opus 5.5 High session still shows Med after updating, run this on the Pi:
```sh
sudo -u claude-st bash -c 'set -a; . /etc/claude-st/claude-st.env; /opt/claude-st/venv/bin/python /opt/claude-st/bridge/claude_bridge.py --probe-code'
```
It prints the newest session's model, the effort it found, and the names of the session's fields, without any content. That's enough for me to point the bridge at the right field.

**To update:** this needs both.
- **Falcon:** copy the attached `CLAUDE.PRG` over the old one.
- **Pi:**
  ```sh
  cd ~/atari_claude/pi && git pull && sudo ./install.sh
  ```

## Erez, 2026-10-06 16:08

I just saw that there is no provisions to create a new project. Will be good to add in the chat popup menu when there is an option to assign the chat to an existing project, to also create a new one. That should be at the top with a three dots that opens a popup window to name the name project and automatically add that chat to it. This menu option should be separated with a line from the other menu options which are the list of existing projects to add the chat to

### Claude

I'll get the latest from GitHub first, since you may have edited files there, then look at the project picker and the rename dialog it can reuse:

The rename dialog can be reused for naming the project. Atari side:

Now the bridge: a `NEWPROJ` command that creates the project and moves the chat into it, for the claude.ai, API and demo backends:

All 69 bridge tests pass. Now in Hatari, using the keyboard: open a chat's menu, choose **Move to project…**, take screenshots of the new picker and the naming dialog, then create the project:

The tests pass. My shell was killed by the restart script again, because this command contained "claude_bridge". I'll run the emulator part on its own:

The notice is gone from the menu, and "Fix my GFA BASIC loop" is now in the new "gfa tips" project. I'll update the guide and protocol docs, bump the version to 1.11 and commit:

I added **New project…** to a chat's **Move to project…** menu. In Hatari with the demo bridge, I created a project called "gfa tips" from a chat's menu, and the chat appeared inside it. The changes are pushed to `whomper/atari_claude` main (`ce0f62d`), and the version is now 1.11.

**New project…** sits at the top, with a line separating it from your existing projects:

```
 New project...
 ──────────────
 Falcon audio
 Demoscene
```

Choosing it opens a small dialog titled **New project** with an empty name field and **Cancel** and **Create** buttons. Type a name and press Return or click **Create**; the project is created and the chat is moved into it. The chat stays highlighted the whole time. If you have no projects yet, the menu shows just **New project…** instead of the old "You have no projects yet" alert.

I also fixed a small flaw I noticed while testing: "Loading projects..." stayed in the title bar while this menu was open.

**Not yet checked:** creating a project on claude.ai uses another unofficial address that I couldn't try on your account. If claude.ai refuses, the Atari shows its error message in the chat area; send it to me if that happens.

The bridge's 69 tests pass, including new ones for creating a project on claude.ai, with the API backend, and in the demo. The user guide and protocol notes describe the new option, with a screenshot.

**To update:** this needs both.
- **Falcon:** copy the attached `CLAUDE.PRG` over the old one.
- **Pi:**
  ```sh
  cd ~/atari_claude/pi && git pull && sudo ./install.sh
  ```

## Erez, 2026-10-06 16:12

Why have I seen you say something about GFA basic?

### Claude

GFA BASIC comes from the demo data, not from your account.

When I test changes, I run Claude ST in the Hatari emulator with the bridge's **demo backend** instead of your claude.ai account. That way I never touch your real chats, and I don't need your session key. The demo backend has a few made-up sample chats so there's something to click on:

- Atari Falcon DSP tricks
- Fix my GFA BASIC loop
- Ideas for a demoscene intro
- a short Hebrew chat about the Falcon, to test right-to-left text

I picked them as Atari-flavoured examples, and GFA BASIC is a classic ST language. For the New project test I used the second sample chat and named its new project "gfa tips" after it. That's all it was. Nothing was created or changed in your claude.ai account.

The same sample chats appear in the screenshots in the README and user guide. The guide says they come from the demo backend, which is why the status line in them reads *Online: demo*.

## Erez, 2026-10-06 16:13

So give me a list of what parts of the overall code base is in each coding language

### Claude

Here's the split by language, counted from the files in the repository (about 10,100 lines of text in all):

| Language | Lines | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| **C** (freestanding, for the 68000) | ~5,050 | `st/claude.c` (3,504) | The whole Atari program: window, sidebar, menus, word wrap, tooltips, dialogs, the protocol, settings |
| | | `st/gem.c`, `gem.h` | Its own AES and VDI bindings, the calls into GEM |
| | | `st/tos.c`, `tos.h` | GEMDOS, BIOS and XBIOS calls, a mini C library, 68000 multiply and divide helpers |
| | | `st/sting.c`, `sting.h` | The STinG network client |
| | | `st/bidi.c`, `bidi.h`, `bidi_test.c` | Hebrew right-to-left layout, and its tests, which run on the build machine |
| | | `st/icon.h`, `icon16.h` | The two icons as pixel data, generated by a script |
| | | `tools/fakesting/fakesting.c` | A stand-in for STinG, for testing in the emulator |
| | | `tools/icon/rsctest.c` | A small Atari program that checks the icon resource file |
| **68000 assembly** | ~90 | `st/crt0.S` | Program startup on TOS |
| | | `st/sting.S` | Glue for calling STinG, which uses Pure C's calling convention |
| | | `tools/fakesting/fstart.S` | Startup for the STinG stand-in |
| | | (also inline in `tos.c` and `gem.c`) | The `trap` instructions into TOS and GEM |
| **Python 3** | ~3,930 | `bridge/backends.py` (1,538) | Talking to claude.ai, the Anthropic API, and the demo data |
| | | `bridge/claude_bridge.py` | The bridge: network and serial links, the protocol, the command-line options and probes |
| | | `bridge/atari_text.py` | Atari character set conversion, and turning Markdown into plain text |
| | | `bridge/test_bridge.py` (1,060) | The bridge's 69 tests |
| | | `tools/elf2tos.py` | Turns the compiler's output into a TOS `.PRG` |
| | | `tools/icon/make_icon.py`, `make_rsc.py` | Draw the icons and write the icon files |
| **Shell (bash)** | ~270 | `pi/install.sh` | The Pi installer |
| | | `tools/hatari-test.sh` | Runs Claude ST in Hatari with a local bridge |
| **Build and config files** | ~160 | `Makefile`s, `link.ld` files | How the Atari programs are built and laid out in memory |
| | | `pi/claude-st.service` | The systemd service on the Pi |
| | | `bridge/requirements.txt`, `st/CLAUDE.INF` | Python packages; example Atari settings |
| **Markdown** | ~620 | `README.md`, `docs/GUIDE.md`, `PROTOCOL.md` | Documentation |

There are also 18 binary files: the screenshots and icon images (`.png`), the built programs (`CLAUDE.PRG`, `FAKESTNG.PRG`, `RSCTEST.PRG`), and the desktop icon files (`.RSC`, `.ICN`).

In short, everything that runs on the Atari is C with a little 68000 assembly. Everything that runs on the Pi is Python, plus a shell script to install it.

## Erez, 2026-10-06 16:27

I am working on a social media reel to promote this work. Lets have a meaningful demo material for your to run it and record a movie for me. The movie should be an Atari ST desktop in Falcon 16 colors resolution, having the claud app icon on the desktop, clicking it to launch, seeing meaningful set of chat and then you type a new chat and watch how claude returns the answer.

### Claude

This is a bigger job, so first I'll check what the emulator setup can do. A Falcon in Hatari has two hurdles:
1. Claude ST must reach the bridge through the Falcon's own serial port.
2. EmuTOS's desktop must show our icon for `CLAUDE.PRG`.

I'm adding a serial-port option so the emulated Falcon can reach the bridge. Testing it now:

The emulated Falcon now connects to the bridge in 16 colours. Next, the desktop icon. I'll check what EmuTOS's documentation says about custom icons and desktop shortcuts:

EmuTOS loads custom desktop icons from `EMUICON.RSC` and supports desktop shortcuts to programs. I'll check EmuTOS's source for the exact format of a shortcut line in `EMUDESK.INF`:

The format is clear enough to write the desktop file directly. I'll check how EmuTOS writes its drive and trash lines, so the hand-made desktop matches what EmuTOS would save:

I read the icon width and height from the wrong fields. Fixing that:

The icon came through intact as icon 14. Now a desktop file with the drives, trash and a **Claude ST** shortcut using that icon, and a Falcon boot to the desktop instead of straight into the app:

I'm doing a dry run of the recording script. Two small fixes first: reuse the virtual display if one is already running, and remove a leftover line:

Hatari's window never appeared. Its log should say why:

Hatari creates its control pipe itself, so my script mustn't create it first:

Hatari is running and recording now, but my script can't find its window. I'll check what the window is called:

The window is there and named "Hatari v2.4.1", so the name search should work. I'll reproduce the script's exact steps to find the difference:

That works on its own, so the difference is timing or one of the recording options. I'll make the window lookup retry and also match on the window class:

Still working on the demo video. The first take works end to end, and I'm now fixing its timing and polishing the content. Re-extracting those frames:

Second take:

The script read a screenshot before Hatari had finished writing it. It'll now retry until the file is complete:

The run timed out, so the desktop check never matched. I'll check the desktop colour in an earlier screenshot:

The desktop isn't solid green: it's a dither of green and white pixels, so a single pixel can be white. I'll test an area for green pixels instead:

The check now finds 800 green pixels in the test area, well above the threshold. I'll avoid a soon-to-be-removed Pillow function, then record the next take:

No screenshots were written at all. I'll test the screenshot command against a running Falcon directly:

Still timing out. I'll add progress messages to see where it stops:

That was my own fault: the `pkill` pattern matched my own command, which ended the shell. I'll run it again without that:

The demo take is recording in the background. I'll check the result when it finishes.

The take has started and is waiting for the Falcon to reach the desktop.

The desktop came up after 6.9 seconds; the scripted session is running now.

The Claude ST icon has been double-clicked; the rest of the session is still running.

The demo is now typing the question into the new chat.

The scripted session finished after 54 seconds; the video is encoding now.

Recording finished at full speed (49 frames per second); encoding the two videos now.

Committed. Sending you both videos now:

I've recorded the demo and attached two versions, each 47 seconds:
- **`claude-st-reel.mp4`:** 1080×1920, vertical for Reels, Shorts and TikTok, with the Atari screen in the middle on black.
- **`claude-st-falcon.mp4`:** 1280×960, 4:3.

Both show an emulated Falcon in 640×480 with 16 colours, scaled up with sharp pixels.

| Time | What happens |
|---|---|
| 0–4 s | The green Falcon desktop, with drives, Trash and a **Claude ST** icon. The pointer moves to it and double-clicks. |
| 5–10 s | Claude ST opens, connects, and fills the sidebar with chats. One title is Hebrew, shown right to left. |
| 11–17 s | It opens "68000: fastest way to clear the screen", showing a question, an answer and a block of assembly code, with the model chip reading *Opus 5.5 · High*. |
| 19–27 s | **+ New chat**, then "Why is the Atari ST still loved today?" is typed at a natural pace. |
| 28–47 s | *Claude is thinking…*, then the answer streams in word by word, the chat gets its title, and it moves to the top of Recents. |

**Before you post it:** the chats and the answer are scripted demo content, not your account and not a live reply. I can't reach your claude.ai account from here. So I wrote a realistic set of Atari chats and the answer myself, the way Claude would answer, and the demo bridge streams it at a natural pace. The screen shows *Online: claude.ai*, as it would on your setup, but nothing in the video came from claude.ai. Everything else is real: the actual Claude ST program running on an emulated Falcon, with its real interface, desktop icon, protocol and streaming. If you'd rather show a genuine live reply, film your real Falcon, or ask me to change the demo's question and answer.

**What I added to make it work** (pushed to `whomper/atari_claude` main, `ea8687b`, version 1.12):
- **A `port` line for `CLAUDE.INF`** to choose the serial port on a TT or Falcon. In the emulator it was needed because Hatari only connects the Falcon's ST-style serial port. On a real TT it also lets you pick any of its four ports. Your Falcon doesn't need it.
- **`tools/icon/add_to_emuicon.py`** adds the Claude ST icon to EmuTOS's desktop icon file. That's how the icon appears on the desktop, and it also works on a real Atari running EmuTOS.
- **`tools/reel/record.py`** and **`tools/reel/reel_bridge.py`** record the whole video again with one command, if you want a different question, answer or set of chats. Both are documented in the user guide.

The recording monitor timed out on its own after the recording had already finished, so it doesn't change anything: both videos are complete and already sent to you. Nothing else is running in the background.

## Erez, 2026-10-07 04:25

I just saw that claude.ai added a timeline separator to the chat list and have attached a picture. Add it to our application

*[1 image attached]*

### Claude

I'll add date headings to the lists the way claude.ai does: **Today**, **Yesterday**, then dates such as **Oct 5**, with the year for anything older than this year. Pinned chats stay at the top under a **Pinned** heading. The bridge knows each chat's date, so it will send the headings as a new kind of list line; the Atari draws them as non-clickable grey rows. Let me look at the relevant code on both sides:

I'm adding date headings to the chat lists. The bridge part is in; now I'll give the demo chats dates and run the tests:

Those three tests compare whole list entries, which now carry a date. I'll make them compare only the fields they check:

All 72 tests pass, including new ones for the headings. I'll give the demo-video chats dates too, so a future recording shows the headings, then look at it in Hatari:

The chat list now has date headings like claude.ai's, including the **Older** section from your second screenshot. The changes are pushed to `whomper/atari_claude` main (`7cfd8fe`), the version is now 1.13, and the bridge's 72 tests pass, including new ones for the headings.

The headings, top to bottom:
- **Pinned:** your pinned chats come first, if you have any.
- **Today** and **Yesterday.**
- **A date such as Oct 4** for each of the other days in the last week.
- **Older** for everything before that, as in your screenshot.

They appear in grey and can't be clicked or right-clicked; Tab skips over them. The same grouping applies to Chats, a project's chats, search results and Code sessions. The Projects and Artifacts lists have no headings.

The dates come from when each chat was last updated on claude.ai, and the Pi works out "Today" and "Yesterday" in its own time zone. If the Pi's clock or time zone is wrong, the grouping will be off.

The attached screenshot shows the new list with the demo chats; the README's main picture is updated to match.

**One trade-off:** each heading takes a row, so slightly fewer chats fit on screen at once; scroll the list as usual. claude.ai also leaves blank space around its headings, but I left that out to keep as many chats visible as possible.

**To update:** this needs both.
- **Falcon:** copy the attached `CLAUDE.PRG` over the old one.
- **Pi:**
  ```sh
  cd ~/atari_claude/pi && git pull && sudo ./install.sh
  ```

## Erez, 2026-10-07 05:14

Why can't I download the 2 videos you have created?

### Claude

I'll check whether the video files are still there:

I'm not sure why the download failed, but the files themselves are fine. My best guess is that I sent them as previews the app tried to play inline instead of offering a download, and that preview may not support MP4.

I've made them available two other ways:

1. **Sent again as plain attachments** just above, which should give you download cards rather than previews: `claude-st-reel.mp4` (1080×1920, 1.5 MB) and `claude-st-falcon.mp4` (1280×960, 1.1 MB).
2. **On GitHub**, in the `docs/demo` folder of `whomper/atari_claude`, pushed in commit `55b6c18`. On each file's page, use **Download raw file** (the download arrow at the top right).
   - https://github.com/whomper/atari_claude/blob/main/docs/demo/claude-st-reel.mp4
   - https://github.com/whomper/atari_claude/blob/main/docs/demo/claude-st-falcon.mp4

   If the repository is still private, sign in to GitHub first.

If the attachments still won't download, say what you see when you tap them (an error, nothing happening, or a player that doesn't load), and I'll try another format, such as an animated GIF or a ZIP file.

The hook is about the copies of the videos I put in the YouTube repository's folder for the attachments. That folder isn't part of the project, and the videos are already in the `atari_claude` repository. Rather than committing videos to the YouTube repository, I'll check what's untracked and remove those copies:

I deleted the two video copies I'd put in the YouTube repository's folder, which is what that warning was about. That repository has no untracked files now, and nothing needed committing there.

The videos are still available:
- **GitHub:** in `docs/demo` of `whomper/atari_claude`, commit `55b6c18`.
- **The attachment cards** in my previous message, which were already sent.
- **This environment's scratch folder,** which is session-only, so it won't keep them after this session ends.

## Erez, 2026-10-07 05:15

Yes, loading them to GitHub is a great move as I am able to download them

### Claude

I'm glad the GitHub download works. From now on, I'll put any new videos or other large files there too, alongside the attachments.

The two files are in `docs/demo` on `whomper/atari_claude`:
- `claude-st-reel.mp4`: 1080×1920, vertical, for Reels, Shorts and TikTok.
- `claude-st-falcon.mp4`: 1280×960, 4:3.

If you later want a different question, answer or set of chats in the video, or a version that shows the new date headings in the list, I can record a new one with `tools/reel/record.py` and put it in the same folder.

## Erez, 2026-10-07 14:43

I get claude.ai completion failed: HTTP 409

### Claude

HTTP 409 means "conflict": claude.ai refused because the message didn't fit the chat's current state. Without claude.ai's full error text I can't tell which case you hit. I'll look at how the bridge sends a message:

The bridge now retries automatically when claude.ai answers a message with HTTP 409. The fix is pushed to `whomper/atari_claude` main (`b691559`), and the bridge's 74 tests pass, including two new ones for this case. I couldn't reproduce the error against your real account, though, so it's not yet confirmed to fix your case.

**What 409 means:** claude.ai refused the message because the chat wasn't in the state the bridge expected. The two likely reasons are:
- **The chat changed elsewhere,** for example you added a message on the website or phone after opening the chat on the Atari, so the Atari's reply was attached to an older message.
- **A reply was still being written** in that chat, for example an earlier answer hadn't finished.

**What the bridge does now:**
1. **Retries:** on a 409, it waits a couple of seconds, asks claude.ai for the chat's latest message, and sends again, up to three attempts in all.
2. **Without the model and effort:** if it still conflicts, it makes the last attempt without the model and effort settings, in case one of them is the cause.
3. **Shows the reason:** if it still fails, the error on the Atari includes claude.ai's own explanation, not just "HTTP 409".

Only the Pi needs updating:
```sh
cd ~/atari_claude/pi && git pull && sudo ./install.sh
```

If it happens again after that, send me the full error text. You can also see each attempt and claude.ai's answer on the Pi with:
```sh
journalctl -u claude-st | grep -A1 "409"
```

### Claude

Your log shows two things:

1. **The 409 errors come with no explanation,** yet claude.ai normally sends one. The cause is a bug in my code: the bridge asks claude.ai for a streamed reply, and for a streamed response it never read the error text before reporting. So we can't yet tell why claude.ai refuses.
2. **HTTP 429 means "too many requests".** It can be the bridge's retries piling up. It can also be claude.ai's usage limit; in that case, sending the same message on the website should show a limit message too.

I'll fix the error reading first, and make a 429 report itself clearly:

The tests now also check that the error text is read from a streamed response. Committing:

The 409 isn't fixed yet; first I need claude.ai's reason for refusing.

**What your log shows:** claude.ai rejected your messages with HTTP 409, and later with 429. My retry ran, but every attempt got another 409 with no explanation attached. That's because the bridge never read claude.ai's explanation: it asks for a streamed reply, and for a streamed response the error text is empty until it's read. That's fixed now (pushed to `whomper/atari_claude` main, `f124f56`, and the bridge's 74 tests pass). The Pi's log and the Atari's error will now include claude.ai's reason, and the Atari explains a 429 in plain words.

**About the 429 ("too many requests"):** it can mean two things:
- **The retries:** my retries added extra requests on top of your own attempts, which can trip claude.ai's rate limit. That clears after a few minutes.
- **Your usage limit:** you may have reached it. Press **F8** on the Atari, or check the Usage page on claude.ai, to see whether the current session is near 100%.

**Next steps:**
1. **Update the Pi:**
   ```sh
   cd ~/atari_claude/pi && git pull && sudo ./install.sh
   ```
2. **Send one message** from the Atari after a few minutes' pause, in the same chat that failed.
3. **If it fails, send me the log lines:**
   ```sh
   journalctl -u claude-st --since "10 min ago" | grep -i "completion"
   ```
   These now include claude.ai's own explanation.
4. **Try one more thing:** does sending a message in that same chat on the claude.ai website work right now? If the website gives an error too, the problem is on claude.ai's side or your usage limit, not the bridge. Also tell me whether it fails only in that chat or in a new chat too. I suspect a chat that changed elsewhere, or a reply that was still being written, but claude.ai's explanation will settle it.

## Erez, 2026-10-07 14:49

On usage I see 25% current session, 31% this week and cloud session credits at 100% in the ST UI but not in the web UI... Strange

### Claude

Those numbers explain part of the picture:

- **Your usage limit isn't the problem:** 25% of the current session and 31% of the week leave plenty of room. So the 429 was almost certainly my retries piling up requests, not your limit.
- **The cloud session credits now show 100% used.** Earlier the web showed "$9 of $100 left", or 91% used. That credit pays for cloud sessions like this Claude Code conversation, so building Claude ST in it has likely used up the rest. The website most likely hides a credit that is used up, while the bridge still showed it.

I'll make the bridge match the website: hide the credit once it's fully used or past its expiry date.

Both readings are consistent with what's happening, and I've changed the bridge to match the website.

**Cloud session credits at 100%:** this credit pays for cloud sessions, such as this Claude Code conversation where we've been building Claude ST. A few days ago you had $9 of $100 left, and the work since then has very likely used up the rest. The website most likely hides a credit once it's used up, but my bridge kept showing it at 100%. Now the Account page leaves out the cloud session credit once it's fully used or past its expiry date. That's pushed to `whomper/atari_claude` main (`ea7df8c`), and the bridge's 75 tests pass.

Once the credit is gone, cloud sessions like this one count against your plan's regular usage, as claude.ai's description of the credit said.

**What this means for the 409 and 429 errors:**
- **Your usage limit is fine.** At 25% of the session and 31% of the week, it isn't the cause.
- **The 429 was most likely my retries:** each failed message triggered several quick retries, enough for claude.ai to say "too many requests". That clears by itself after a few minutes.
- **The 409 is still unexplained.** The update I sent before this one makes the bridge record claude.ai's reason, so the next failure will tell us.

**Next:**
1. **Update the Pi,** which brings both changes:
   ```sh
   cd ~/atari_claude/pi && git pull && sudo ./install.sh
   ```
2. **Wait a few minutes,** then send one message from the Atari.
3. **If it fails, send me the output of:**
   ```sh
   journalctl -u claude-st --since "10 min ago" | grep -i "completion"
   ```

### Claude

Now we have claude.ai's reason:

> **"This chat is available in the new Claude experience. Reopen it there to keep going."** (`error_code: conversation_upgraded`)

So claude.ai has moved that chat (`dcb33660…`) into its newer chat system. The interface the bridge uses can still read the chat but can no longer add to it. Retrying can never help, and the retries are what tripped the "Rate limited" 429.

I'll make the bridge:
1. **Not retry** an "upgraded" chat, and show a clear message on the Atari instead.
2. **Log claude.ai's full error,** which was cut off mid-word.
3. **Get a `--probe-chat` option** that shows what claude.ai stores about a chat, so we can learn how the new system is reached.

The tests pass, and the new option shows up in `--help`. I'll check it runs before the "need a link option" check, like the other probes:

The log found it. claude.ai has moved that chat (`dcb33660…`) into a newer chat system it calls "the new Claude experience". The interface the bridge uses can still read the chat but can no longer add messages to it, so every send gets a 409 with the reason `conversation_upgraded`.

**Why you also got 429s:** my retries kept resending to a chat that could never accept a message, so claude.ai rate-limited them. That clears by itself after a few minutes.

**What I changed** (pushed to `whomper/atari_claude` main, `0877c53`; the bridge's 76 tests pass):
- **Stops straight away:** the bridge no longer retries a moved chat, so it won't trigger the rate limit.
- **Clear message:** the Atari says claude.ai has moved this chat to its new chat system, which Claude ST can't continue yet. You can still read it on the Atari; to keep going, start a new chat or continue it on claude.ai.
- **Full error in the log:** claude.ai's whole error is logged, no longer cut off mid-word.
- **`--probe-chat`:** shows which fields claude.ai keeps for one chat, without its messages.

**What I don't know yet:** whether all chats are moving to the new system, including brand-new ones, and how the new system is reached. If new chats are affected too, Claude ST needs to learn the new system before it can send at all. That would be a bigger change, and I'd need what claude.ai reports about a moved chat.

**Please:**
1. **Update the Pi:**
   ```sh
   cd ~/atari_claude/pi && git pull && sudo ./install.sh
   ```
2. **Wait a few minutes** so the rate limit clears.
3. **Start a new chat on the Atari** and send a message. Tell me whether it works.
4. **Run this on the Pi** for the chat that was moved, and send me the output:
   ```sh
   sudo -u claude-st bash -c 'set -a; . /etc/claude-st/claude-st.env; /opt/claude-st/venv/bin/python /opt/claude-st/bridge/claude_bridge.py --probe-chat dcb33660-2956-4c6c-8e3e-2162e5e64280'
   ```
   It lists the chat's fields and settings, such as its title, dates and model, and just the number of messages. It shows no message text.

## Erez, 2026-10-07 14:54

A new chat works.
This is the output of the Pi command:

uuid: 'dcb33660-2956-4c6c-8e3e-2162e5e64280'
workspace_upgraded: True

### Claude

That settles it, and it tells us more:

- **`workspace_upgraded: True`:** claude.ai marks a moved chat with this flag. The bridge can now spot a moved chat as soon as you open it, before you type anything.
- **New chats work,** so only some older chats are affected. This one is a long chat (114 messages) that was moved.
- **`"effort_level": "medium"` under `settings`:** this is where claude.ai keeps a chat's effort. My effort search already finds it, so the chip shows the real value. It also shows how to save an effort change properly: by updating that setting on the chat.

So I'll make two changes:
1. **Moved chats:** opening one shows a note that Claude ST can read it but not add to it. Typing in it gives that note immediately, without sending anything to claude.ai.
2. **Effort changes:** saved into the chat's `effort_level` setting on claude.ai, keeping its other settings unchanged, so the website sees them too.

A new chat must never inherit the read-only state from a moved chat opened before it, so I'll reset it whenever a new chat starts:

All 78 tests pass, including new ones for moved chats and the saved effort. I'll update the user guide and commit:

Your probe output pinned it down: claude.ai flags moved chats with `workspace_upgraded: True`. Since new chats work, only older chats it has moved are affected. The bridge now uses that flag. The changes are pushed to `whomper/atari_claude` main (`e276304`), and the bridge's 78 tests pass, including new ones for moved chats and the saved effort.

**Moved chats are handled up front:**
- **Opening one** still shows the whole conversation, with a note at the end: *claude.ai has moved this chat to its new chat system. Claude ST can show it, but can't add to it: to keep going, start a new chat, or continue this one on claude.ai.*
- **Typing in one** gives the same note, and nothing is sent to claude.ai, so no more 409 errors or rate limiting.
- **Other chats** work as before, even right after you open a moved one.

**The effort is now saved where claude.ai keeps it.** Your output also showed that a chat's effort lives in its settings (`"effort_level": "medium"`):
- **Reading:** the chip already shows that value.
- **Saving:** changing the effort on the Atari now updates that setting on claude.ai, leaving the chat's other settings as they were, so the website shows the same effort.

I haven't tried that save against your account. Please change the effort on one chat and check that the website then shows the same level.

The troubleshooting section of the user guide now explains the moved-chat message.

Only the Pi needs updating:
```sh
cd ~/atari_claude/pi && git pull && sudo ./install.sh
```

**Not supported yet:** continuing moved chats from the Atari. claude.ai's newer chat system is reached in a different way that I couldn't find. If you'd like that, the next step is to look at what the website sends when you continue a moved chat; I can walk you through capturing that in your browser's developer tools.

## Erez, 2026-10-07 14:56

Yes, I would like to have moved chats work as before on my ST

### Claude

Yes. To make that work, I need to see how the claude.ai website itself continues a moved chat, which I can't observe from here. A short capture in your browser's developer tools will show it. Please do this on a desktop computer in Chrome:

1. **Open the moved chat:** go to claude.ai and open *Atari 600XL monitor signal troubleshooting*.
2. **Open the developer tools:** press **Cmd+Option+I** on a Mac, or **F12** on Windows. Click the **Network** tab.
3. **Prepare the Network tab:** tick **Preserve log**, click **Fetch/XHR** in the filter row, and click the 🚫 button to clear the list.
4. **Send a short message** in the chat, for example `test`, and wait for the reply to finish.
5. **Take a screenshot of the Network list.** It shows the names of the requests the page made.
6. **For the request that sent your message,** click it. Its name will probably contain `completion`, `messages`, `turn`, `sessions` or `events`; if you're unsure, check the few that appeared right after you pressed Send. Then copy these four things:
   - **Headers tab, under General:** the **Request URL** and **Request Method**.
   - **Headers tab, under Request Headers:** the header **names** only, such as `anthropic-client-platform`. Skip `Cookie` completely.
   - **Payload tab:** the whole request body. It contains your `test` message, and that's fine.
   - **Response or EventStream tab:** the first 10–20 lines.

Paste all of that here, with the screenshot.

**Don't share any `Cookie` or `sessionKey` value,** and don't use *Copy as cURL* or *Save as HAR*. Both include your cookies, which give full access to your account.

With that, I can teach the bridge to continue moved chats the same way the website does. Until then, those chats stay readable but can't be continued from the Atari.

## Erez, 2026-10-07 15:00

I could not get past step 3, where am I finding the Preserve Log and Fetch/XHR? Is it somewhere in the Network tab?

### Claude

Yes, both are in the Network tab, in the toolbars along its top. In Chrome:

**Row 1, the toolbar right under the tabs:**
```
 ●  🚫  ⏷  🔍  │ ☐ Preserve log  ☐ Disable cache │ No throttling ▾  …
```
- **●** (red or grey dot) records. It should be red; click it if it's grey.
- **🚫** clears the list.
- **☐ Preserve log** is the checkbox just to the right of these icons. Tick it.

**Row 2, the filter row under it:**
```
 Filter [__________]   All  Fetch/XHR  Doc  CSS  JS  Font  Img  Media  …
```
- **Fetch/XHR** is one of the small buttons after the Filter box. Click it.

**If you don't see them:**
- **No filter row:** click the funnel icon **⏷** in row 1, and row 2 appears.
- **Preserve log is cut off:** the panel is too narrow. Make the developer tools wider by dragging its left edge, or look for **»** at the end of row 1.

**Neither is essential.** If you can't find them, just make sure the Network tab is open before you send the message. After sending, type `completion` in the **Filter** box to find the request. If nothing matches, try `messages` or `chat`.

If you're using **Safari** rather than Chrome, it's arranged differently. Tell me and I'll describe where things are there.

## Erez, 2026-10-07 15:01

This is what I have

*[1 image attached]*

### Claude

That's Safari's Web Inspector, not Chrome, so things are in different places, but you're in the right tab. The list currently shows only the files loaded when the page opened. Nothing from sending a message is there yet. In Safari:

1. **Clear the list:** click the **trash can** at the far right of the row with *Disable Caches · Import · Export*.
2. **Keep only data requests:** click **All ⌃**, next to *Filter Full URL* at the top left, and choose **XHR/Fetch**. The `.js` files then disappear.
3. **Send a short message:** with the Inspector still open, type `test` in the moved chat and send it. Wait for the reply to finish. New rows will appear, with *claude.ai* in the Domain column.
4. **Take a screenshot of the list,** so I can see the new rows' names.
5. **Click the row that sent your message.** It's probably one whose name contains `completion`, `messages`, `turn` or `events`, or a path starting with `v1`. A details panel opens on the right. In its **Headers** tab:
   - **Summary:** copy the **URL** and **Method**.
   - **Request Headers:** copy the header **names** only. Skip `Cookie` completely.
   - **Request Data**, near the bottom: copy all of it. It contains your `test` message.
6. **Response:** in the **Preview** or **Response** tab, copy the first 10–20 lines.

You can ignore *Preserve Log*. In Safari it's tucked away, and you don't need it, because sending a message doesn't reload the page.

**A useful clue already:** your console shows the page calling `claude.ai/v1/toolbox/…`. That suggests the newer chat system uses `/v1/…` addresses, unlike the `/api/…` addresses the bridge uses today, which fits what we've seen.

As before, don't copy any `Cookie` value, and don't use **Export**, since it saves your cookies.

## Erez, 2026-10-07 15:08

[Pasted here: the JSON reply of claude.ai's chat list (`chat_conversations_v2`, 176 KB), copied from Safari's network inspector. It is left out of this log because it holds the titles and summaries of unrelated private chats. The part that mattered was the moved chat's entry:]

```json

### Claude

The guide has a `run` helper; use that form instead.

The bridge change is done and tested, but GitHub keeps rejecting the push with a server error. I'm retrying.

I've added support for continuing moved chats, so you don't need to capture the request for sending a message. It isn't on GitHub yet, though: GitHub has refused every push so far with an "Internal Server Error". The change is committed on my side and a retry runs every minute for the next 10 minutes. I'll tell you once it's through, and only then will `git pull` on the Pi pick it up.

Only the Pi changes; `CLAUDE.PRG` stays the same. I've only tested this against a simulated claude.ai, not the real one.

**What I found:** the moved chat's details include `"workspace_session_id": "cse_01LdkojPGyMvEsXj1sp7NE5u"`. Your Network list shows the page loading exactly that name. A moved chat continues in a "session", stored the same way as your Claude Code sessions, and the bridge can already read and reply to those.

**What changes:**
- **Opening a moved chat** shows the older messages plus anything said since the move.
- **Sending** posts your message to that session, and Claude's answer appears as it comes in. Moved chats no longer use the old route that answered HTTP 409.
- **If that doesn't work for a chat,** it falls back to read-only as before, now with a note that the new part couldn't be opened.
- **The check command** for one chat (`--probe-chat`) now also checks that chat's session. It shows the session's message count, but not the messages.

**To test once the push is through:**
1. Update the Pi:
   ```sh
   cd ~/atari_claude/pi && git pull && sudo ./install.sh
   ```
2. On the ST, open "Atari 600XL monitor signal troubleshooting" and send a short message.
3. If something fails, run this on the Pi and send me the output. It shows chat settings and message counts, not your content.
   ```sh
   run() { sudo -u claude-st bash -c "set -a; . /etc/claude-st/claude-st.env; /opt/claude-st/venv/bin/python /opt/claude-st/bridge/claude_bridge.py $*"; }
   run --probe-chat dcb33660-2956-4c6c-8e3e-2162e5e64280
   ```

**Your second screenshot shows your `Cookie` header.** Most of it is visible, and the part shown includes sign-in tokens; your `sessionKey` may be in the cut-off part. To be safe:
1. Log out of claude.ai in Safari and log back in.
2. Copy the new `sessionKey`.
3. Run `sudo ./install.sh --set-key` on the Pi.

## Erez, 2026-10-07 15:15

Can I install from git?

### Claude

Not yet: GitHub is still refusing every push from me with an "Internal Server Error", so `git pull` on the Pi won't find the change yet. A test push to a separate branch fails the same way. A retry is still running.

In the meantime you can apply the change directly on the Pi. Paste this whole block into the Pi's terminal; it changes the two bridge files and reinstalls:

PATCH
```

If `git apply` complains, run `cd ~/atari_claude && git pull` first and paste the block again. Your copy needs to be at the latest version on GitHub (commit e276304) for the change to fit.

Then on the ST, open the 600XL chat and send a short message.

**Once my push gets through:** this change edits files in your copy, so a plain `git pull` would refuse. Run this instead:
```sh
cd ~/atari_claude && git checkout -- bridge && git pull && cd pi && sudo ./install.sh
```

Nothing changes on the ST side.

The push went through, so the change is on GitHub now (commit dab0ffe) and you can install it from git.

**If you haven't pasted the earlier block yet**, run the normal update on the Pi and skip the block:
```sh
cd ~/atari_claude/pi && git pull && sudo ./install.sh
```

**If you already pasted it**, run this instead, since a plain `git pull` would refuse because of the changed files:
```sh
cd ~/atari_claude && git checkout -- bridge && git pull && cd pi && sudo ./install.sh
```

Then on the ST, open the 600XL chat and send a short message. `CLAUDE.PRG` stays the same. If sending fails, run the `--probe-chat` check from my earlier message and send me its output.

workspace_upgraded: True

### Claude

Tests pass. Next, the `run` helper in the guide.

I've fixed and pushed this. Your probe output showed the problem: when the bridge asks claude.ai for one chat, the reply leaves out the moved chat's session ID (`workspace_session_id`). Without it, the bridge couldn't find the new part of the chat and fell back to read-only. Only claude.ai's chat list (the long JSON you pasted earlier) includes it, so the bridge now looks the ID up there. All the bridge tests pass, but they only simulate claude.ai, so your test on the ST is the real check.

The `claudeai: command not found` line came from my check command. It read your settings file the wrong way, and it was harmless. The corrected version is below and in the guide.

**Update the Pi** (only the Pi changes; `CLAUDE.PRG` stays the same):
```sh
cd ~/atari_claude && git checkout -- bridge && git pull && cd pi && sudo ./install.sh
```

Then open the 600XL chat on the ST and send a short message. It should no longer say the chat is read-only.

**If it still fails,** run this and send me the output:
```sh
run() { sudo -u claude-st bash -c 'while IFS="=" read -r k v; do case "$k" in [A-Z]*) export "$k=$v";; esac; done < /etc/claude-st/claude-st.env; exec /opt/claude-st/venv/bin/python /opt/claude-st/bridge/claude_bridge.py "$@"' run "$@"; }
run --probe-chat dcb33660-2956-4c6c-8e3e-2162e5e64280
```
It now ends with a line saying whether the session was found. If it was, it also says how many messages the session holds, without showing them.

## Erez, 2026-10-07 15:29

It seems to work. Now, when opening the ST application, don't preselect any chat since the main chat pane is empty while a chat is selected to the left

### Claude

Good to hear moved chats are working. Claude ST now starts with no chat selected, and the new `CLAUDE.PRG` (1.14) is attached. The fix needs both the new `CLAUDE.PRG` and a bridge update on the Pi; it's pushed to GitHub. The bridge tests pass and the program builds, but I haven't run it on an ST or in Hatari.

**Why it happened:** the bridge keeps running when you quit Claude ST, so it still remembered the chat you last had open. When the ST connected again, the bridge reported that chat, so the list highlighted it while the right-hand pane was empty.

**The fix:** when Claude ST connects, it now tells the bridge which chat it is showing. Just after starting, that's none, so the bridge starts a new chat and nothing is highlighted. If the connection drops while a chat is open, the reconnect still keeps that chat.

**Update the Pi:**
```sh
cd ~/atari_claude/pi && git pull && sudo ./install.sh
```
Then copy the attached `CLAUDE.PRG` over the one on the ST. The two halves work with each other's older versions, but the fix needs both.

## Erez, 2026-10-07 15:34

Your latest change generated two bombs and a stuck Falcon

### Claude

Two bombs means a bus error. I'll reproduce it in Hatari before guessing.

The serial ST in Hatari starts fine with no chat selected, so I'm now trying the Falcon with STinG in Hatari.

I haven't been able to make 1.14 crash. I ran it in the Hatari emulator on an emulated Falcon and an ST, over a serial connection and over the emulated network. I also tried the exact case the change adds: the bridge still holding a chat from the last run. Each time it started normally with no chat selected and no bombs.

The 1.14 change on the ST is a single line: when Claude ST connects, it also tells the bridge which chat it has open, which at startup is none. So two bombs (a bus error) is surprising. It could be something specific to your real Falcon, or the copy of `CLAUDE.PRG` got damaged on the way over.

I've attached the previous version (1.13) so you can keep working; rename it to `CLAUDE.PRG`. It works with the updated bridge, which just goes back to the old behaviour (the leftover chat highlighted).

To find the cause, could you tell me:

1. **When do the bombs appear?** Before the window opens, while it says *Connecting…*, after the chat list appears, or when you click something?
2. **Is the copy on the Falcon intact?** Its size should be **46,672 bytes**. If you have a Mac, `md5 CLAUDE.PRG` should give `e6df8d3a55f964a77919a8feaebb0044`.
3. **Does 1.13 start normally now?** If it doesn't, the cause is on the Pi side, not the new program.
4. **What does the bridge log show at the moment it crashes?** Run this on the Pi and send me the last lines:
   ```sh
   journalctl -u claude-st -n 30 --no-pager
   ```

## Erez, 2026-10-07 15:42

The bombs show before any window is opened. 113 starts correctly

### Claude

I'll put the ST program back to 1.13 exactly and make the change on the bridge only.

I've put the ST program back to 1.13 and moved the fix to the Pi's bridge only. Keep running the 1.13 `CLAUDE.PRG` you have; the version on GitHub is now byte-for-byte the same file. I don't know what made 1.14 crash on your Falcon, since it started normally in the emulator. With 1.14 withdrawn I've stopped looking into it.

The bridge now forgets the last chat whenever Claude ST connects, so the list starts with nothing selected. The bridge tests pass; I haven't tested it on the Falcon.

Update the Pi:
```sh
cd ~/atari_claude/pi && git pull && sudo ./install.sh
```

One side effect: if the network drops while a chat is open, the reconnect also forgets that chat. Your next message would then start a new chat instead of continuing the one on screen; clicking that chat in the list again fixes it.

## Erez, 2026-10-07 15:57

Why can't you distinguish first time launch from normal operation? Moe the firs time launch into the ST application, no pre-selecting anything and keep the cached last chat on the Pi

### Claude

Built. Now checking it in Hatari with a bridge that still holds a chat from a previous run.

You're right, it can tell: Claude ST knows when it has just started. I've moved the fix into the ST program and put the bridge back to remembering the last chat. The new `CLAUDE.PRG` (1.14) is attached.

- **Just after launch:** Claude ST doesn't highlight the chat the Pi remembers. That lasts until you open a chat or start a new one.
- **First message from the empty start screen:** it starts a new chat, so it doesn't land in the chat from your last session.
- **Network drops while a chat is open:** the bridge still has that chat, so after reconnecting you carry on in it.

I tested this in Hatari on an emulated Falcon, with the bridge still holding a chat from a previous run. It started with nothing selected, and the first message created a new chat (screenshots of before and after sending looked right).

This build is new and differs from the 1.14 that bombed. That one ran fine in the emulator but crashed on your Falcon before any window opened, and I still don't know why. Check the size first: it should be **46,743 bytes**. If the size is right and it bombs anyway, the crash isn't a damaged copy, and I'll need to look into it on the real hardware side.

Update the Pi too:
```sh
cd ~/atari_claude/pi && git pull && sudo ./install.sh
```

## Erez, 2026-10-08 05:26

This is what I'm getting just now, tried 2 times

*[1 image attached]*

### Claude

claude.ai is refusing requests ("rate_limit_error", "Rate limited. Please try again later."). That's a different error from the usage-limit one, so I'm checking whether the bridge itself has been sending too many requests.

A test caught a mistake in my edit; fixing it.

That error comes from claude.ai: the message reads "Rate limited", which isn't the usage-limit error. claude.ai is blocking requests because too many arrived too quickly. The bridge probably sent most of them.

**The likely cause:** after you send a message to a moved chat, the bridge keeps asking claude.ai every 2 seconds whether the reply is done. For moved chats, claude.ai probably never sends the "finished" signal the bridge waits for. So the bridge likely kept asking for 15 minutes after each message, about 450 requests each time. That would explain the rate limit, which then blocks your other chats too, like this one.

**The fix, now pushed:**
- The bridge stops checking a moved chat 8 seconds after the reply goes quiet.
- While waiting for a reply, it checks less often, from every 2 seconds up to every 10. This applies to Code sessions too.
- The bridge tests pass, including a new one that confirms the checking stops soon after a reply.

Only the Pi changes:
```sh
cd ~/atari_claude/pi && git pull && sudo ./install.sh
```
Updating also restarts the bridge, which stops any checking that's still running. claude.ai's rate limit then wears off by itself; give it a while (I don't know how long) before trying again.

If you still get this error after updating and waiting, send me the output of:
```sh
journalctl -u claude-st --since "1 hour ago" --no-pager | tail -40
```

## Erez, 2026-10-08 19:51

When looking for artifacts, search only on the last 40 chats. Then order based on creation and last update date.

### Claude

Fixing a test for the new list format, then adding one for the ordering.

Artifacts now come from your last 40 chats only (it was 100), so the scan is quicker and sends far fewer requests to claude.ai.

**Order:** newest first, by when Claude last updated each artifact. Artifacts updated at the same time go by when they were created. The list also gets date headings (Today, Yesterday, a date, Older), like the chat list.

The bridge tests pass, including a new one for this order. Only the Pi changes:
```sh
cd ~/atari_claude/pi && git pull && sudo ./install.sh
```

If you ever added `--artifact-scan` yourself to the settings file on the Pi, that number still overrides the 40.

## Erez, 2026-10-09 13:45

Does our claude st support claude code? Can I get access to the claude code work item s?

### Claude

Yes, Claude ST already supports Claude Code. **Code** in the left menu (or `F6`) lists your Claude Code sessions from claude.ai/code, newest first. These are the cloud sessions you start at claude.ai/code, like this one.

**What you can do with a session:**
- **Read it:** your messages and Claude's replies. Each action Claude took shows as a one-line note, such as `[Bash: make -C st]`; the action's output isn't shown.
- **Reply:** what you type goes to the open session, and Claude's replies appear as it works. If it's still working after 15 minutes, Claude ST stops waiting; open the session again later to see the rest.
- **Model and effort:** the chip in the title bar shows the session's own model, and changing it switches only that session.
- **Rename or archive:** right-click a session, or press `Insert`.

**What it can't do yet:**
- **Start a new session:** a new session needs a repository and environment chosen, and there's no picker for that on the ST yet.
- **See the work itself:** the file changes (diffs), pull requests and the output of each action.
- **See sessions running on your own computer:** only the cloud ones from claude.ai/code are listed, not sessions running in the Claude Code app on your Mac.

If by "work items" you mean something other than these sessions, such as the pull requests or the changes a session made, tell me which and I'll look at adding it. Starting a new Code session from the ST would be the most useful addition.

## Erez, 2026-10-09 15:19

In another chat and code project, we are working on removing the dependency of a Pi gateway for SSL and encryption. Can this be used also here for this app?

### Claude

I found the other project: it's MAIL's TLS measurements (`whomper/mail`, `tools/tlsbench`). The short answer: the encryption part can be reused, but it only covers part of what the Pi does for Claude ST, so going without the Pi would only work in limited cases.

**What carries over:** your measurements show an accelerated Falcon can do TLS itself.
- **Handshake:** about 1.5 seconds, with X25519 on the 68030 and the RSA checks on the DSP.
- **Speed:** 33–66 KB/s from fast RAM, plenty for streaming Claude's replies.

The same BearSSL port could go into Claude ST. Both programs talk through STinG the same way, so the connection code would fit.

**What the Pi does beyond encryption:**
1. **Getting past claude.ai's bot protection.** claude.ai sits behind Cloudflare, which turns away clients that don't look like a real browser. That's why the installer adds `curl_cffi`: it makes the bridge's encrypted connection look like Chrome's. A BearSSL connection from the Falcon would look nothing like a browser, and I expect Cloudflare to block it. This is the biggest risk, and only a real test will tell. Your mail servers don't have this problem.
2. **Shrinking chats.** claude.ai sends a long chat as one big JSON reply, often several megabytes, full of tool and artifact data. The bridge reduces that to plain text and only the last 40 messages before the ST sees it. On the Atari, that work and the memory it needs would move to the Falcon.
3. **Everything else the bridge handles:**
   - finding artifacts and unpacking Word files
   - Hebrew and character-set conversion
   - the moved-chat sessions and the Code sessions
   - usage and account information
   - following claude.ai's frequent changes, which today only needs a `git pull` on the Pi
4. **Machines.** This would only work on a Falcon with an accelerator and fast RAM. Your figures for a stock 68030 in ST-RAM already show a 13-second handshake; a 68000 ST or STE would be slower still, and has no DSP. Those machines would keep needing the Pi.

**A realistic path:**
- **Keep the Pi as the normal setup.**
- **Add a "direct" mode for the accelerated Falcon using the Anthropic API instead of claude.ai.** The API is meant for programs, needs only an API key, and has no browser check. Its replies are small and simple to stream, which suits an Atari much better. The catch: the API is paid per use, separate from your claude.ai plan, and those chats wouldn't appear in your claude.ai account.
- **Going directly to claude.ai** is only worth attempting if the test below gets past Cloudflare.

A good first step is a small test program built from your `tlsbench` code. It would open one encrypted connection from the Falcon to `claude.ai` and one to `api.anthropic.com`. It would then report whether each one connects or gets blocked, and how long the handshake takes. Shall I build that?

## Erez, 2026-10-09 15:26

I see, in that case it make less sense to go that path at the moment

### Claude

Agreed. The Pi stays as the bridge for Claude ST, and nothing changes in the project.

If you ever want to take it further, the first step is still the connection test: one encrypted connection from the Falcon to claude.ai and one to the Anthropic API. If Cloudflare lets the Falcon's connection through, going without the Pi becomes realistic; if not, the API route is the only option.

## Erez, 2026-10-09 20:11

So can it also show claude code chats and joint work?

### Claude

Claude Code chats, yes: they're the **Code** list in Claude ST (`F6`). It shows your Claude Code sessions from claude.ai/code, like this one, newest first. You can open one, read the conversation (each action Claude took shows as a one-line note), and reply.

"Joint work" could mean a few things. Which one did you have in mind?

1. **Chats you share with other people.** claude.ai marks some chats as shared with others (they carry an `is_multiplayer` flag). Claude ST doesn't treat them differently yet. Your chats so far aren't shared, so I haven't been able to see what they look like.
2. **Projects someone else shares with you.** Claude ST lists the projects claude.ai returns for your account. I haven't checked whether that includes projects other people shared with you.
3. **What a Code session produced:** the file changes, pull requests and the output of each action. Claude ST doesn't show these yet; it shows only the conversation and one-line notes of the actions.
4. **Cowork sessions,** if you use Claude Cowork alongside Claude Code. Claude ST doesn't list them.

Tell me which one, or something else, and I'll check what claude.ai offers for it.

## Erez, 2026-10-10 05:53

Write BUILD_STORY.md in the repo: my first prompt, the milestones in order, interesting aspects of the work, the main bugs and how we fixed them, and what the app does now. This will be used to create social posts and reel so pick the pieces that would be most interesting for audience. Commit and push

### Claude

I've gathered the history from the conversation and the git log, and I'm writing the story now. First a few size figures.

I've written `BUILD_STORY.md` and pushed it to the repo: [github.com/whomper/atari_claude/blob/main/BUILD_STORY.md](https://github.com/whomper/atari_claude/blob/main/BUILD_STORY.md). It's attached here too. The figures and dates come from this conversation and the git history.

What's in it:
- **Your first prompt,** word for word.
- **The numbers:**
  - 7 days and about 80 prompts
  - 5,000 lines of C and 4,000 of Python
  - a 46 KB program running on a 1985 computer
- **Milestones by day:** from a working app on day 1, with WiFi, menus and Hebrew, through the Code sessions, the demo video and the date headings, to fixing moved chats.
- **Interesting aspects:**
  - an AI building a client for itself
  - your phone photos of the Falcon as the testing loop
  - Hebrew on an Atari
  - claude.ai changing under the app twice in a week
  - the "Iguana necktie" credit
  - a demo video recorded with no camera
- **The main bugs and how they were fixed:**
  - only the top two artifacts would open
  - the missing cover letters
  - the HTTP 409/429 hunt using Safari's network inspector
  - the two bombs on the Falcon
  - your "why can't you tell a fresh start from a reconnect?" push-back, which led to the better fix
- **What Claude ST does now,** as a short list.
- **A table of the videos and screenshots** in the repo to use in posts and the reel.

For a hook, I'd suggest the "AI building a client for itself" angle or the phone photos of the Falcon screen.

## Erez, 2026-10-10 06:12

Good, now I need another export but this time for all our conversation, raw export from all my prompts and all your responses. This will then be used for a guide on the actual steps we took. Export and store on GitHub the same way and generate a good name for this file

### Claude

I'll export your prompts and my written replies from the session log. My working steps (commands, file reads) are left out. The repo is public, so first I'll scan for anything private that shouldn't go up.
